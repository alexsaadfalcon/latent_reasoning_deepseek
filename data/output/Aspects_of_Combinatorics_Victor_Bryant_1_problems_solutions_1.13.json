Each person is going to buy a 50p ice cream. The stall-keeper doesn't have any change, so whenever a person with a \u00a31 coin comes up, the stall-keeper needs to give them a 50p coin as change. The question is asking for the probability that the stall-keeper always has enough change to serve all the customers, considering the people in the queue as steps in a grid. Hmm, that sounds a bit like a classic probability problem.\n\nLet me think. So, we have m people with 50p coins and n people with \u00a31 coins. The stall-keeper starts with zero change. Each time a person with a \u00a31 coin comes, the stall-keeper gives them a 50p coin, so the number of change decreases by one. Each time a person with a 50p coin comes, the change increases by one. The key here is that at no point during the queue should the number of people with \u00a31 coins exceed the number of people with 50p coins. Otherwise, the stall-keeper would run out of change and not be able to serve everyone.\n\nThis reminds me of the classic \"ballot problem\" or \"random walk problem.\" In the ballot problem, we often calculate the probability that one candidate is always ahead of another in the vote count. Similarly, here, we want the probability that the number of \u00a31 coins never exceeds the number of 50p coins at any point in the queue.\n\nLet me recall the formula for such probabilities. I think it's related to the Catalan numbers. The probability that in a sequence of m + n steps, with m up steps and n down steps, the path never goes below the starting point is given by the Catalan number formula.\n\nThe formula is (Catalan number) / (Total number of sequences). The Catalan number C_n is given by (1/(n+1)) * (2n choose n). But in this case, we have m and n, so maybe it's (1/(m + 1)) * (2(m + n) choose m). Wait, no, that might not be exactly right.\n\nWait, actually, the probability is given by the formula:\n\nProbability = (number of valid sequences) / (total number of sequences)\n\nThe number of valid sequences is the Catalan number C_m,n, which is (m - n)/(m + n) * (2(m + n) choose m). But I might be mixing things up.\n\nWait, no, actually, the formula for the probability that in a sequence of m + n steps, with m up and n down steps, the path never goes below the starting point is:\n\nProbability = (C(m, n) - C(m - 1, n)) / C(m + n, n)\n\nBut I think that's not quite right either. Maybe I should think in terms of the reflection principle.\n\nThe reflection principle is used in combinatorics to count the number of paths that cross a certain boundary. In this case, we want the number of paths that never cross below the x-axis, starting at 0, with m up steps and n down steps.\n\nThe formula for the number of such paths is given by the Catalan-like formula:\n\nNumber of valid paths = (m - n)/(m + n) * (2(m + n) choose m)\n\nBut wait, that formula is only valid when m >= n. If m < n, the probability is zero because the number of \u00a31 coins exceeds the number of 50p coins at some point.\n\nSo, assuming m >= n, the probability is:\n\nProbability = (m - n)/(m + n) * (2(m + n) choose m) / (2(m + n) choose n)\n\nSimplifying that, we get:\n\nProbability = (m - n)/(m + n) * (m + n)! / (m! n!) / (2(m + n) choose n)\n\nBut (2(m + n) choose n) is equal to (2(m + n)!)/(m! n! (m + n)!)). Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, actually, (2(m + n) choose n) is equal to (2(m + n)!)/(n! (m + n)!)). So, substituting back, the probability becomes:\n\nProbability = (m - n)/(m + n) * (m + n)! / (m! n!) / (2(m + n)!)/(n! (m + n)!))\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nProbability = (m - n)/(m + n) * (m + n)! / (m! n!) * n! (m + n)! / (2(m + n)!))\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.\n\nLet me try another approach. The number of valid sequences is given by the Catalan number formula:\n\nNumber of valid sequences = (m - n)/(m + n) * (2(m + n) choose m)\n\nAnd the total number of sequences is (m + n choose n).\n\nTherefore, the probability is:\n\nProbability = [(m - n)/(m + n) * (2(m + n) choose m)] / [(m + n choose n)]\n\nSimplify this expression.\n\nFirst, note that (2(m + n) choose m) = (2(m + n)!)/(m! n! (m + n)!))\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. (2(m + n) choose m) is (2(m + n)!)/(m! (m + n)!)). Wait, no, that's not right either.\n\nWait, actually, (2(m + n) choose m) is (2(m + n)!)/(m! (2(m + n) - m)!)) = (2(m + n)!)/(m! (m + n)!))\n\nSimilarly, (m + n choose n) is (m + n)!/(n! (m + n)!)) = 1/(n!).\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\nProbability = [(m - n)/(m + n) * (2(m + n)!)/(m! (m + n)!))] / [1/(n!))\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n= [(m - n)/(m + n) * (2(m + n)!)/(m! (m + n)!))] * n!\n\n= (m - n)/(m + n) * (2(m + n)! * n!) / (m! (m + n)!))\n\nSimplify (m + n)! in numerator and denominator:\n\n= (m - n)/(m + n) * (2 * n!) / (m! )\n\nSo, Probability = (m - n)/(m + n) * (2 * n!) / (m! )\n\nBut (2 * n!)/(m! ) is equal to 2 / (m (m - 1) ... (n + 1)) )\n\nWait, maybe it's better to write it as:\n\nProbability = (m - n)/(m + n) * (2 * (m + n)! / (m! n!)) / ( (m + n)! / (n! m! )) )\n\nWait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nThe number of valid sequences is (m - n)/(m + n) * (2(m + n) choose m). The total number of sequences is (m + n choose n).\n\nSo, Probability = [ (m - n)/(m + n) * (2(m + n) choose m) ] / [ (m + n choose n) ]\n\nExpressed as:\n\nProbability = (m - n)/(m + n) * [ (2(m + n)!)/(m! n! (m + n)!)) ] / [ (m + n)!/(n! m! ) ]\n\nWait, that seems messy. Maybe I should use the formula for the probability of a balanced parentheses problem, which is similar.\n\nIn the balanced parentheses problem, the probability that a string of m up and n down steps never goes below zero is given by the Catalan number formula.\n\nIn our case, m is the number of up steps (50p coins) and n is the number of down steps (\u00a31 coins). So, the probability is:\n\nProbability = (1/(m + 1)) * (2(m + n) choose m) / (2(m + n) choose n)\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right.\n\nWait, actually, the formula is:\n\nProbability = (m - n)/(m + n) * (2(m + n) choose m) / (2(m + n) choose n)\n\nBut (2(m + n) choose n) is equal to (2(m + n)!)/(n! (m + n)!))\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\nProbability = (m - n)/(m + n) * (2(m + n)!)/(m! n! (m + n)!)) / (2(m + n)!)/(n! (m + n)!))\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nProbability = (m - n)/(m + n) * (2(m + n)!)/(m! n! (m + n)!)) * (n! (m + n)!)/(2(m + n)!))\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe 2(m + n)! cancels out, as does (m + n)! in numerator and denominator.\n\nSo, we're left with:\n\nProbability = (m - n)/(m + n) * (1)/(m! )\n\nWait, that seems too simple. Let me check.\n\nWait, no, actually, (2(m + n)!)/(m! n! (m + n)!)) is equal to (2)/(m"
