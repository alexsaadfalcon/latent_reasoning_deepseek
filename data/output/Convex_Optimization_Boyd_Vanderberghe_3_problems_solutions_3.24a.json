First, I should clarify what \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\) represents. It might be a notation specific to a particular context, such as a set or a structure in mathematics.\n\nAssuming \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\) refers to the lexicographical order of a set \\( K \\), I should determine the order of elements in \\( K \\) based on their names or definitions.\n\nNext, I'll list the elements of \\( K \\) and sort them lexicographically. This involves comparing the elements using their names or alphabetical order if applicable.\n\nAfter sorting, the first element in the sorted list will be \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\).\n\nFinally, I'll present the result as the lexicographical order of \\( K \\).\n</think>\n\nTo find \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\), we need to determine the lexicographical order of the set \\( K \\). Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Understand the Notation**: \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\) likely refers to the lexicographical order of the set \\( K \\). This means we need to sort the elements of \\( K \\) in dictionary order.\n\n2. **List the Elements**: Identify all the elements in the set \\( K \\).\n\n3. **Sort Lexicographically**: Arrange the elements of \\( K \\) in ascending order based on their names or definitions.\n\n4. **Determine \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\)**: The first element in the sorted list is \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{K^*_{\\text{lex}}}\n\\]\n\nThis represents the lexicographical order of the set \\( K \\), where the elements are arranged from the smallest to the largest based on their names or definitions."
