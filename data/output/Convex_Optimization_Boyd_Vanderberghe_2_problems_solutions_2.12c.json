Think briefly and provide a simple answer in the form of a statement or equation.\nWhich of the following sets are convex? A wedge, i.e., {x \u2208 R^n| a^T_1 x \u2264 b_1, a^T_2 x \u2264 b_2}.\n<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c>\n<think>\n<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this problem about convex sets, specifically a wedge defined by the inequalities a\u2081\u1d40x \u2264 b\u2081 and a\u2082\u1d40x \u2264 b\u2082. I need to figure out which of these sets are convex. Hmm, let me start by recalling what a convex set is. A set is convex if, for any two points within the set, the line segment connecting them is entirely contained within the set. So, if I take any two points x and y in the wedge, the point z = \u03bbx + (1 - \u03bb)y for any \u03bb between 0 and 1 should also be in the wedge.\n\nLet me write down the definition again to make sure I have it right. A set S is convex if for all x, y \u2208 S and for all \u03bb \u2208 [0,1], \u03bbx + (1 - \u03bb)y \u2208 S. So, applying this to the wedge defined by a\u2081\u1d40x \u2264 b\u2081 and a\u2082\u1d40x \u2264 b\u2082, I need to check if for any two points x and y in the wedge, the point z = \u03bbx + (1 - \u03bb)y also satisfies both inequalities.\n\nLet me break it down. Suppose x and y are in the wedge. That means a\u2081\u1d40x \u2264 b\u2081 and a\u2082\u1d40x \u2264 b\u2082. Similarly, a\u2081\u1d40y \u2264 b\u2081 and a\u2082\u1d40y \u2264 b\u2082. Now, consider z = \u03bbx + (1 - \u03bb)y. I need to check if a\u2081\u1d40z \u2264 b\u2081 and a\u2082\u1d40z \u2264 b\u2082.\n\nCalculating a\u2081\u1d40z, that's a\u2081\u1d40(\u03bbx + (1 - \u03bb)y) = \u03bb(a\u2081\u1d40x) + (1 - \u03bb)(a\u2081\u1d40y). Since a\u2081\u1d40x \u2264 b\u2081 and a\u2081\u1d40y \u2264 b\u2081, and \u03bb and (1 - \u03bb) are between 0 and 1, the weighted average should also be \u2264 b\u2081. Similarly, a\u2082\u1d40z = \u03bb(a\u2082\u1d40x) + (1 - \u03bb)(a\u2082\u1d40y) \u2264 \u03bbb\u2081 + (1 - \u03bb)b\u2081 = b\u2081. So, z satisfies both inequalities.\n\nWait, does this hold for any number of inequalities? Let me think. If I have more inequalities, say a\u2083\u1d40x \u2264 b\u2083, would the same logic apply? Let's see. If x and y satisfy all the inequalities, then for any \u03bb, z will satisfy each inequality because each a\u1d62\u1d40z = \u03bba\u1d62\u1d40x + (1 - \u03bb)a\u1d62\u1d40y \u2264 \u03bbb\u1d62 + (1 - \u03bb)b\u1d62 = b\u1d62. So, yes, the same reasoning applies for any number of inequalities.\n\nTherefore, the wedge defined by multiple linear inequalities is convex because the line segment between any two points in the set will also lie within the set. So, the wedge is convex.\n\nI think that's the reasoning. So, the wedge is convex because it's defined by linear inequalities, and the set of points satisfying linear inequalities is convex.\n</think>\n\nThe wedge defined by the inequalities \\( a_1^\\top x \\leq b_1 \\) and \\( a_2^\\top x \\leq b_2 \\) is convex. This is because for any two points \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) within the wedge, the point \\( z = \\lambda x + (1 - \\lambda) y \\) for any \\( \\lambda \\in [0, 1] \\) also satisfies both inequalities. Hence, the set is convex.\n\n**Answer:** The wedge is convex."
