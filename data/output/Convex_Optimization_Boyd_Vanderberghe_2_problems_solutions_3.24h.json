    "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a certain function is convex, concave, quasiconvex, or quasiconcave. The function in question is the minimum width interval that contains 90% of the probability mass of a random variable x. The random variable x takes values in {a\u2081, a\u2082, ..., a\u2099} with probabilities p\u2081, p\u2082, ..., p\u2099 respectively, and it's given that a\u2081 < a\u2082 < ... < a\u2099. The function is defined as the infimum of \u03b2 - \u03b1 such that the probability of x being between \u03b1 and \u03b2 is at least 0.9.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a probability distribution over n points, and we're looking at the minimum interval [\u03b1, \u03b2] that contains at least 90% of the probability mass. The function we're interested in is the length of this interval, which is \u03b2 - \u03b1. We need to determine if this function is convex, concave, quasiconvex, or quasiconcave.\n\nTo approach this, I think I should first express the function mathematically. Let me denote the function as f(p), where p is the probability vector (p\u2081, p\u2082, ..., p\u2099). The function f(p) is the minimum width such that the probability of x being in [\u03b1, \u03b2] is at least 0.9. So, f(p) = inf{\u03b2 - \u03b1 | P(\u03b1 \u2264 x \u2264 \u03b2) \u2265 0.9}.\n\nNow, I need to analyze the properties of this function. Since it's defined on the probability simplex, it's a function from R^n\u208a to R, with the constraint that the sum of p_i is 1.\n\nI recall that convexity and concavity can be determined by checking the second derivatives, but since this is a function defined on a simplex, it might be more straightforward to analyze it using properties of convex sets and optimization.\n\nQuasiconvexity and quasiconcavity are related to the function's level sets. A function is quasiconvex if all its sublevel sets are convex, and it's quasiconcave if all its superlevel sets are convex.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider the function's behavior under scaling. For example, if we scale the probabilities p_i by a positive constant, how does the function f(p) behave? If f(kp) = f(p) for any k > 0, then the function is homogeneous of degree 0, which is a property of homogeneous functions. But I'm not sure if that directly helps with convexity or quasiconvexity.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the structure of the function f(p). Since it's the minimum width containing 90% probability, it's related to the quantiles of the distribution. Specifically, it's the difference between the 90th and 10th percentile, or something similar, depending on how the probability is distributed.\n\nBut actually, it's not exactly the difference between two specific quantiles. Instead, it's the smallest interval that contains at least 90% of the probability. So, it's a measure of the spread of the distribution that captures the 90% most probable outcomes.\n\nI think this function is related to the concept of dispersion in probability distributions. It's a measure of how spread out the distribution is, capturing the range that contains the most probable outcomes.\n\nNow, to determine if it's convex, concave, quasiconvex, or quasiconcave, I need to analyze how it behaves with respect to changes in the probabilities p_i.\n\nLet me consider two different probability distributions and see how f(p) behaves when I perturb the probabilities.\n\nSuppose I have two distributions p and q, and I create a new distribution r that is a convex combination of p and q. That is, r_i = \u03bb p_i + (1 - \u03bb) q_i for some \u03bb \u2208 (0,1). I want to see if f(r) is less than or equal to the maximum of f(p) and f(q), which would indicate convexity, or greater than or equal to the minimum, which would indicate concavity.\n\nBut wait, actually, for convexity, we need that f(\u03bb p + (1 - \u03bb) q) \u2264 \u03bb f(p) + (1 - \u03bb) f(q). Similarly, for concavity, it's the opposite inequality.\n\nAlternatively, for quasiconvexity, we need that if p is in the sublevel set of f, then so is any convex combination of p and another point in the sublevel set. Similarly, for quasiconcavity, the opposite.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think about specific examples. Let me consider a simple case where n=2. Suppose we have two points, a\u2081 and a\u2082, with probabilities p and 1-p. Then, the minimum width interval that contains 90% probability is simply [a\u2081, a\u2082] if p \u2265 0.9, or [a\u2081, a\u2082] if p \u2264 0.1, or [a\u2081, a\u2082] if p is between 0.1 and 0.9. Wait, no, actually, if p is the probability of a\u2081, then the interval containing at least 90% probability would be [a\u2081, a\u2082] if p \u2265 0.9, but if p is less than 0.9, then we need to include a\u2081 and some a_j such that the cumulative probability reaches 0.9.\n\nWait, no, in the case of n=2, the minimum width interval that contains 90% probability is either [a\u2081, a\u2082] if p \u2265 0.9, or if p < 0.9, then we need to include a\u2081 and some a_j such that the cumulative probability up to a_j is at least 0.9. So, in that case, the width would be a_j - a\u2081.\n\nSimilarly, if p is between 0.1 and 0.9, then the width would be a_j - a\u2081, where j is such that the cumulative probability up to a_j is at least 0.9.\n\nWait, but in the case of n=2, the function f(p) is actually a step function. It's constant at a\u2082 - a\u2081 when p \u2265 0.9, and when p < 0.9, it's a_j - a\u2081 where j is the smallest index such that the cumulative probability up to a_j is at least 0.9.\n\nSo, in this case, f(p) is a step function that decreases as p increases. So, it's a non-increasing function. But is it convex or concave?\n\nWait, in the case of n=2, the function f(p) is non-increasing, so it's concave if it's linear, but in this case, it's a step function, which is concave because it's non-increasing and the difference between consecutive points is constant.\n\nWait, actually, in the case of n=2, the function f(p) is a step function. For p \u2265 0.9, f(p) = a\u2082 - a\u2081. For p < 0.9, f(p) = a_j - a\u2081, where j is the smallest index such that the cumulative probability up to a_j is at least 0.9.\n\nSo, in this case, f(p) is a step function that is constant for p \u2265 0.9 and decreases as p increases from 0 to 0.9. So, it's a non-increasing function, which is concave because the slope is non-positive.\n\nBut wait, is it concave? Let me recall that a function is concave if the line segment between any two points lies above the function. In this case, since f(p) is non-increasing, the line segment between any two points would lie above the function, which is concave.\n\nSimilarly, for convexity, a function is convex if the line segment between any two points lies below the function. But in this case, since f(p) is non-increasing, the line segment would lie above the function, so it's concave.\n\nWait, but actually, in the case of n=2, the function f(p) is not necessarily concave or convex because it's a step function. It's concave if the function is convex, but in this case, it's a step function, which is concave.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think more carefully. For a function to be concave, for any p, q and \u03bb \u2208 [0,1], f(\u03bb p + (1 - \u03bb) q) \u2265 \u03bb f(p) + (1 - \u03bb) f(q). Similarly, for convexity, the inequality is reversed.\n\nIn the case of n=2, f(p) is a step function. Let's say a\u2081 < a\u2082. Then, for p \u2265 0.9, f(p) = a\u2082 - a\u2081. For p < 0.9, f(p) = a_j - a\u2081, where j is the smallest index such that the cumulative probability up to a_j is at least 0.9.\n\nSo, suppose p1 < p2, and f(p1) = a_j - a\u2081, f(p2) = a_k - a\u2081, where j < k. Then, for \u03bb \u2208 [0,1], f(\u03bb p1 + (1 - \u03bb) p2) is either a_j - a\u2081 or a_k - a\u2081, depending on whether \u03bb p1 + (1 -"
