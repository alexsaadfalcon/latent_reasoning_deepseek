First, I should clarify what \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\) represents. It could be a notation specific to a particular context or problem. Without additional information, I'll assume it's a lexicographical order or a dual star notation.\n\nIf it's lexicographical order, \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\) might refer to the lexicographical ordering of some set or sequence. However, since no specific elements are provided, I'll consider it as a dual star symbol in a lexicographical context.\n\nAssuming \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\) is a dual star applied to a lexicographical order, it might represent a dual or inverse transformation in that ordering. Without more details, I'll state that \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\) is the dual lexicographical order of \\( K \\), but I'm not certain without additional context.\n</think>\n\nTo solve for \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\), we need to understand the context in which this notation is used. Assuming \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\) refers to the dual lexicographical order of a set or sequence \\( K \\), the result would depend on the specific elements of \\( K \\). However, since no additional information is provided, we can only state that \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\) represents the dual lexicographical order of \\( K \\).\n\n\\[\nK^*_{\\text{lex}} = \\text{Dual Lexicographical Order of } K\n\\]\n\n\\boxed{K^*_{\\text{lex}} = \\text{Dual Lexicographical Order of } K}"
