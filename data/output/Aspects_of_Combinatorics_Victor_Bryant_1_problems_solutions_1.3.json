Think briefly and provide a simple answer in the form of a statement or equation with LaTeX formatting.\nHow many solutions are there of the equation $x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_k = n$ where each $x_i$ is a positive integer?\n<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c>\n<think>\n<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the number of solutions to the equation \\( x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_k = n \\) where each \\( x_i \\) is a positive integer. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that this is a classic combinatorics problem. It seems like a problem about distributing indistinguishable objects into distinguishable boxes. Each \\( x_i \\) represents the number of objects in each box, and since they're positive integers, each box must have at least one object. \n\nWait, so if each \\( x_i \\) is at least 1, maybe I can transform the equation to make it easier. Let me subtract 1 from each \\( x_i \\). That would give me \\( (x_1 - 1) + (x_2 - 1) + \\cdots + (x_k - 1) = n - k \\). Let me denote \\( y_i = x_i - 1 \\), so each \\( y_i \\) is a non-negative integer (since \\( x_i \\) is at least 1). \n\nSo now, the equation becomes \\( y_1 + y_2 + \\cdots + y_k = n - k \\), where each \\( y_i \\geq 0 \\). This is a standard stars and bars problem, right? I recall that the number of non-negative integer solutions to this equation is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{n - 1}{k - 1} \\). \n\nWait, let me make sure I'm recalling the formula correctly. The stars and bars theorem states that the number of ways to distribute \\( n \\) indistinguishable items into \\( k \\) distinguishable bins is \\( \\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1} \\). But in this case, since each \\( y_i \\) is non-negative, it's actually \\( \\binom{n - 1}{k - 1} \\). \n\nHold on, let me double-check. If I have \\( n \\) identical items and \\( k \\) bins, the formula is \\( \\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1} \\). But in our transformed equation, we have \\( n - k \\) items to distribute into \\( k \\) bins, so substituting, it should be \\( \\binom{(n - k) + k - 1}{k - 1} \\), which simplifies to \\( \\binom{n - 1}{k - 1} \\). Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as placing \\( n \\) stars and \\( k - 1 \\) bars. The stars represent the total number of objects, and the bars separate them into \\( k \\) groups. The number of ways to arrange these is \\( \\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1} \\), but since each \\( y_i \\) is non-negative, it's the same as \\( \\binom{n - 1}{k - 1} \\).\n\nWait, another way to think about it is using generating functions. The generating function for each \\( x_i \\) is \\( x + x^2 + x^3 + \\cdots \\), which is \\( \\frac{x}{1 - x} \\). So, for \\( k \\) variables, the generating function is \\( \\left( \\frac{x}{1 - x} \\right)^k \\). The coefficient of \\( x^n \\) in this expansion will give the number of solutions. \n\nExpanding \\( \\left( \\frac{x}{1 - x} \\right)^k \\), we get \\( x^k \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - x} \\right)^k \\). The expansion of \\( \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^k} \\) is \\( \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{m + k - 1}{k - 1} x^m \\). Therefore, multiplying by \\( x^k \\), the coefficient of \\( x^n \\) is \\( \\binom{n - 1}{k - 1} \\). \n\nSo, that confirms it again. The number of solutions is \\( \\binom{n - 1}{k - 1} \\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the substitution. If each \\( x_i \\) is at least 1, then subtracting 1 from each gives \\( y_i \\geq 0 \\), so the equation becomes \\( y_1 + y_2 + \\cdots + y_k = n - k \\). So, the number of non-negative solutions is indeed \\( \\binom{(n - k) + k - 1}{k - 1} = \\binom{n - 1}{k - 1} \\). \n\nAlternatively, if I think about it as stars and bars, imagine you have \\( n \\) stars and \\( k - 1 \\) bars. The number of ways to arrange these is \\( \\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1} \\). But since each \\( y_i \\) can be zero, it's the same as the number of non-negative solutions, which is \\( \\binom{n - 1}{k - 1} \\).\n\nWait, another way to think about it is using the formula for combinations with repetition. The formula is \\( \\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1} \\), but since each \\( y_i \\) is non-negative, it's the same as \\( \\binom{n - 1}{k - 1} \\). \n\nI think I'm consistent here. So, the number of solutions is \\( \\binom{n - 1}{k - 1} \\).\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider a small example. Suppose \\( n = 3 \\) and \\( k = 2 \\). Then, the equation is \\( x_1 + x_2 = 3 \\) with \\( x_1, x_2 \\geq 1 \\). The solutions are (1,2), (2,1), so that's 2 solutions. \n\nUsing the formula, \\( \\binom{3 - 1}{2 - 1} = \\binom{2}{1} = 2 \\). That matches. \n\nAnother example: \\( n = 4 \\), \\( k = 3 \\). The equation is \\( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 4 \\) with each \\( x_i \\geq 1 \\). The solutions are (1,1,2), (1,2,1), (2,1,1), so that's 3 solutions. Using the formula, \\( \\binom{4 - 1}{3 - 1} = \\binom{3}{2} = 3 \\). Perfect, that's correct.\n\nWait, but hold on, in the first example, \\( n = 3 \\), \\( k = 2 \\), the number of solutions is 2, which is \\( \\binom{2}{1} \\). In the second example, \\( n = 4 \\), \\( k = 3 \\), the number of solutions is 3, which is \\( \\binom{3}{2} \\). So, the formula seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the number of solutions is \\( \\binom{n - 1}{k - 1} \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of solutions is \\boxed{\\dbinom{n - 1}{k - 1}}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\( x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_k = n \\) where each \\( x_i \\) is a positive integer, we can transform the problem by subtracting 1 from each \\( x_i \\). This transforms the equation into \\( (x_1 - 1) + (x_2 - 1) + \\cdots + (x_k - 1) = n - k \\), where each \\( y_i = x_i - 1 \\) is a non-negative integer. \n\nThis reduces the problem to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation \\( y_1 + y_2 + \\cdots + y_k = n - k \\). According to the stars and bars theorem, the number of solutions is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{n - 1}{k - 1} \\).\n\nThus, the number of solutions to the original equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dbinom{n - 1}{k - 1}}\n\\]"
