Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Understand the Notation**: \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\) likely refers to the lexicographical order of the sequence \\( K^* \\).\n\n2. **Assume \\( K^* \\) is a Sequence**: Let's assume \\( K^* \\) is a sequence of elements that can be compared lexicographically.\n\n3. **Lexicographical Order**: This order compares elements character by character, similar to dictionary order. If \\( K^* \\) is a sequence, \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\) would be the sorted version of \\( K^* \\) in this order.\n\n4. **Result**: The lexicographical order of \\( K^* \\) is the sequence sorted based on the rules of lexicographical comparison.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\text{ is the lexicographical order of the sequence } K^*}\n\\]"
