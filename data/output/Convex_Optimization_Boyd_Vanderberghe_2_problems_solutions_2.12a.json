A slab, i.e., a set of the form {x \u2208 R^n| \u03b1 \u2264 a^T x \u2264 \u03b2}.\n<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c>\n<think>\n<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which of the given sets are convex. The set in question is a slab, defined as {x \u2208 R^n | \u03b1 \u2264 a^T x \u2264 \u03b2}. Hmm, I remember that a convex set is one where, for any two points in the set, the line segment connecting them is entirely contained within the set. So, I should check if this slab satisfies that condition.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a slab is. It's the set of all vectors x in n-dimensional space such that the linear functional a^T x is between two constants \u03b1 and \u03b2. So, it's like a region between two parallel hyperplanes.\n\nI think about the properties of convex sets. If I have two points x1 and x2 in the slab, then a^T x1 should be between \u03b1 and \u03b2, and similarly for x2. Now, if I take any point x on the line segment between x1 and x2, which can be written as x = (1 - t)x1 + t x2 where t is between 0 and 1, I need to check if a^T x is also between \u03b1 and \u03b2.\n\nLet me compute a^T x. Substituting x, we get a^T [(1 - t)x1 + t x2] = (1 - t)a^T x1 + t a^T x2. Since both a^T x1 and a^T x2 are between \u03b1 and \u03b2, their weighted average should also be between \u03b1 and \u03b2. That makes sense because linear functions preserve convex combinations. So, a^T x will lie between \u03b1 and \u03b2, meaning x is in the slab.\n\nWait, does this hold for any a? I think so, because a is just a linear functional, and linear transformations preserve convexity. So, if the original set is convex, then the image under a linear transformation should also be convex.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the definition of a convex set in terms of inequalities. A set is convex if for any two points in the set, the line segment connecting them lies entirely within the set. Since the slab is defined by two linear inequalities, and the intersection of convex sets is convex, I can check if each inequality defines a convex set.\n\nEach inequality a^T x \u2264 \u03b2 and a^T x \u2265 \u03b1 defines a half-space, which is convex. The intersection of two convex sets is also convex, so the slab, being the intersection of these two half-spaces, should be convex.\n\nI don't think there are any other sets mentioned, so I think the answer is that the slab is convex.\n</think>\n\nThe set {x \u2208 R^n | \u03b1 \u2264 a^T x \u2264 \u03b2} is convex because it is the intersection of two half-spaces, each defined by a linear inequality. Since each half-space is convex and the intersection of convex sets is convex, the slab is convex.\n\n**Answer:** The slab is convex."
