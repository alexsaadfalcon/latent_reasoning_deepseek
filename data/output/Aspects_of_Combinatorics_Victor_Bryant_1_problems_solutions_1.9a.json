Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when you draw lines on a plane, each pair of lines can intersect at most once, right? Because if two lines are not parallel, they must cross each other somewhere. But wait, the problem also says that no three lines meet at the same point. That means every intersection point is only where two lines cross, not three or more. So, each intersection is uniquely determined by exactly two lines.\n\nSo, maybe I can think about this in terms of combinations. Since each intersection is determined by two lines, the number of intersection points should be related to how many ways I can choose two lines from the total number of lines. That sounds like a combination problem.\n\nLet me recall the formula for combinations. The number of ways to choose k elements from a set of m elements without considering the order is given by the combination formula:\n\n$$\nC(m, k) = \\frac{m!}{k!(m - k)!}\n$$\n\nIn this case, I want to choose 2 lines out of n lines. So, substituting m with n and k with 2, the number of intersection points should be:\n\n$$\nC(n, 2) = \\frac{n!}{2!(n - 2)!}\n$$\n\nSimplifying that, the factorial terms will cancel out. Let's see:\n\n$$\nC(n, 2) = \\frac{n(n - 1)(n - 2)!}{2 \\times 1 \\times (n - 2)!} = \\frac{n(n - 1)}{2}\n$$\n\nOh, so that simplifies nicely to (n(n - 1))/2. That makes sense because each line can intersect with every other line exactly once, and since no two lines are parallel, each pair contributes exactly one intersection.\n\nLet me test this with a small number of lines to make sure. Let's take n = 2. If I draw two lines, they intersect once. Plugging into the formula: (2*1)/2 = 1. That works.\n\nHow about n = 3? Three lines, no two parallel, no three meeting at a point. Each pair intersects once, so three intersection points. The formula gives (3*2)/2 = 3. Perfect.\n\nLet me try n = 4. Four lines, each intersecting the others. Each line intersects three others, so 4 lines each with 3 intersections, but wait, that would be 4*3 = 12, but each intersection is counted twice because each intersection involves two lines. So, the actual number is 12/2 = 6. The formula gives (4*3)/2 = 6. That's correct.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have four lines, each new line intersects all the previous ones. So, the first line doesn't intersect anything, the second line intersects the first, so that's one intersection. The third line intersects the first two, so that's two more intersections. The fourth line intersects the first three, so that's three more. So, total intersections: 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Yep, that adds up.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold for these small cases. Therefore, I can be confident that the number of intersection points is indeed (n(n - 1))/2.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about why this works. Each intersection is uniquely determined by two lines, and since no two lines are parallel, each pair contributes exactly one intersection. So, the total number is just the number of pairs of lines, which is the combination of n lines taken 2 at a time.\n\nSo, in general, for n lines, the number of intersection points is C(n, 2) = n(n - 1)/2.\n\nI think that's solid. I can't think of any exceptions or special cases where this wouldn't hold. The problem states that no two lines are parallel and no three lines meet at a point, so every intersection is just two lines crossing, and there's no overlap or multiple intersections at the same point. So, the formula should be accurate.\n\nTherefore, the answer is n(n - 1)/2.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe total number of intersection points is \\boxed{\\dfrac{n(n - 1)}{2}}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of intersection points when drawing \\( n \\) straight lines in the plane, where no two lines are parallel and no three lines meet at a point, we can use the concept of combinations.\n\nEach intersection point is uniquely determined by exactly two lines. Therefore, the number of intersection points is the number of ways to choose 2 lines out of \\( n \\) lines. This is given by the combination formula:\n\n$$\nC(n, 2) = \\frac{n!}{2!(n - 2)!}\n$$\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n$$\nC(n, 2) = \\frac{n(n - 1)(n - 2)!}{2 \\times 1 \\times (n - 2)!} = \\frac{n(n - 1)}{2}\n$$\n\nThus, the total number of intersection points is:\n\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{n(n - 1)}{2}}"
