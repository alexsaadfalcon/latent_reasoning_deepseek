It could be a notation for a specific concept or operation. Since it's not defined in the problem, I'll assume it's related to lexicographical ordering or some related concept.\n\nAssuming \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\) refers to the lexicographical order of a set \\( K \\), I'll consider how to determine the order of elements in \\( K \\) based on their components.\n\nTo find \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\), I'll list the elements of \\( K \\) in a specific order, typically comparing elements component-wise from left to right.\n\nNext, I'll compare each element of \\( K \\) with the others, ensuring that the order is determined by the lexicographical rules.\n\nFinally, I'll present the ordered list of elements in \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\) as the solution.\n</think>\n\nTo find \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\), we need to determine the lexicographical order of the set \\( K \\). Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Understand the Notation**: \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\) likely refers to the lexicographical order of the set \\( K \\). This means we'll arrange the elements of \\( K \\) in a dictionary-like order, comparing elements component-wise.\n\n2. **List the Elements**: Suppose \\( K \\) contains elements \\( k_1, k_2, \\ldots, k_n \\). We'll list these elements in a specific order.\n\n3. **Compare Elements**: Compare each element of \\( K \\) with the others, starting from the first component. The element with the smaller first component comes first. If the first components are equal, move to the second component, and so on.\n\n4. **Determine the Order**: Arrange the elements of \\( K \\) in ascending order based on the lexicographical rules.\n\n5. **Final Order**: The ordered list of elements in \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\) is the result.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{K^*_{\\text{lex}} = \\text{sorted}(K) \\text{ based on lexicographical order}}\n\\]"
