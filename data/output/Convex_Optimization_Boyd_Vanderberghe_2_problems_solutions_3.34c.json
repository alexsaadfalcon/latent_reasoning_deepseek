    "problem": "What is dom M_C?",
    "solution": "<think>\nTo determine the number of dominoes in a standard set, I start by understanding that each domino is represented by two squares, one on each end, which can be the same or different.\n\nNext, I consider the possible combinations. For the first square, there are 6 possible numbers (0 through 5). For the second square, there are also 6 possible numbers, leading to a total of 6 multiplied by 6, which equals 36 possible dominoes.\n\nHowever, this count includes duplicate pairs, such as (0|1) and (1|0), which are considered the same domino. To account for this, I divide the total number of combinations by 2, resulting in 18 unique dominoes.\n\nFinally, I add the two additional dominoes that have the same number on both ends, (0|0) and (5|5), to the total, which brings the final count to 20 dominoes.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of dominoes in a standard set, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Components of a Domino:**\n   - Each domino is represented by two squares, one on each end.\n   - The numbers on these squares can range from 0 to 5.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Combinations:**\n   - For the first square, there are **6** possible numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).\n   - For the second square, there are also **6** possible numbers.\n   - Therefore, the total number of combinations is:\n     \\[\n     6 \\times 6 = 36\n     \\]\n\n3. **Account for Duplicate Pairs:**\n   - The combination (0|1) is the same as (1|0).\n   - To avoid counting duplicates, we divide the total by 2:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{36}{2} = 18\n     \\]\n\n4. **Add the Doubles:**\n   - The dominoes where both squares have the same number (e.g., (0|0), (1|1), ..., (5|5)) are not duplicated.\n   - There are **6** such dominoes.\n\n5. **Final Calculation:**\n   - Add the unique pairs and the doubles:\n     \\[\n     18 + 6 = 24\n     \\]\n\nHowever, upon reviewing the standard domino set, it's important to note that the total number of dominoes in a standard set is **28**. This discrepancy arises because the standard set includes doubles (where both squares are the same number) and excludes the zero square. Therefore, the correct number of dominoes in a standard set is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{28}\n\\]"
