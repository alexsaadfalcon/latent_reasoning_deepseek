The set S is defined as S = {y\u2081a\u2081 + y\u2082a\u2082 | -1 \u2264 y\u2081 \u2264 1, -1 \u2264 y\u2082 \u2264 1}, where a\u2081 and a\u2082 are vectors in R\u207f. \n\nFirst, let me recall what a polyhedron is. A polyhedron is a set of points in n-dimensional space that can be expressed as the intersection of a finite number of half-spaces. In other words, it's a convex set bounded by a finite number of linear inequalities. So, to determine if S is a polyhedron, I need to see if it can be written in the form S = {x | Ax \u2264 b, Fx = g}, where A and F are matrices, and g and b are vectors.\n\nLooking at the definition of S, it's a set of points that are linear combinations of a\u2081 and a\u2082 with coefficients y\u2081 and y\u2082 each ranging between -1 and 1. So, S is essentially all possible linear combinations of a\u2081 and a\u2082 with y\u2081 and y\u2082 constrained to the interval [-1, 1]. \n\nThis structure reminds me of the Minkowski sum. The Minkowski sum of two sets A and B is defined as A + B = {a + b | a \u2208 A, b \u2208 B}. In this case, S is the Minkowski sum of the line segments [-1, 1]a\u2081 and [-1, 1]a\u2082. \n\nSince both [-1, 1]a\u2081 and [-1, 1]a\u2082 are line segments in R\u207f, their Minkowski sum should also be a convex set. Moreover, because each segment is bounded by two linear inequalities (y\u2081 \u2264 1, y\u2081 \u2265 -1, and similarly for y\u2082), the Minkowski sum should also be bounded by a finite number of linear inequalities.\n\nLet me try to express S in the form {x | Ax \u2264 b, Fx = g}. \n\nEach y\u2081 and y\u2082 is between -1 and 1, so we can write the constraints as:\n-1 \u2264 y\u2081 \u2264 1\n-1 \u2264 y\u2082 \u2264 1\n\nBut since S is a linear combination of a\u2081 and a\u2082, we can express each component of x in terms of y\u2081 and y\u2082. Let's denote x = y\u2081a\u2081 + y\u2082a\u2082. \n\nTo find the inequalities defining S, we can consider the extreme points when y\u2081 and y\u2082 take their extreme values. \n\nWhen y\u2081 = 1 and y\u2082 = 1, x = a\u2081 + a\u2082.\nWhen y\u2081 = 1 and y\u2082 = -1, x = a\u2081 - a\u2082.\nWhen y\u2081 = -1 and y\u2082 = 1, x = -a\u2081 + a\u2082.\nWhen y\u2081 = -1 and y\u2082 = -1, x = -a\u2081 - a\u2082.\n\nThese four points are the vertices of the set S. However, since y\u2081 and y\u2082 can vary between -1 and 1, the set S is the convex hull of these four points. \n\nBut wait, actually, since y\u2081 and y\u2082 are independent variables, the set S is the Minkowski sum of the line segments along a\u2081 and a\u2082. So, geometrically, S is a parallelogram (if a\u2081 and a\u2082 are in 2D) or a parallelepiped in higher dimensions.\n\nTo express S as Ax \u2264 b and Fx = g, we can write the inequalities based on the maximum and minimum values of each component of x. \n\nFor each component i of x, the maximum value is achieved when y\u2081 and y\u2082 are at their maximums, and the minimum when they are at their minimums. So, for each i, we have:\n\n- The maximum of x_i occurs when y\u2081 = 1 and y\u2082 = 1, so x_i \u2264 a\u2081_i + a\u2082_i.\n- The minimum of x_i occurs when y\u2081 = -1 and y\u2082 = -1, so x_i \u2265 -a\u2081_i - a\u2082_i.\n\nBut wait, that might not capture all the inequalities because depending on the direction of a\u2081 and a\u2082, the maximum and minimum could be different. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the inequalities that bound each component.\n\nAlternatively, since S is the Minkowski sum, it can be represented as the set of all x such that x = y\u2081a\u2081 + y\u2082a\u2082 with y\u2081, y\u2082 \u2208 [-1, 1]. \n\nTo express this in terms of linear inequalities, we can consider the following:\n\nFor each component i, x_i is a linear combination of y\u2081 and y\u2082 with coefficients a\u2081_i and a\u2082_i. So, x_i = y\u2081a\u2081_i + y\u2082a\u2082_i. \n\nSince y\u2081 and y\u2082 are each bounded between -1 and 1, the maximum and minimum values of x_i occur at the corners of the y\u2081-y\u2082 square. \n\nTherefore, for each i, the maximum x_i is a\u2081_i + a\u2082_i, and the minimum x_i is -a\u2081_i - a\u2082_i. \n\nBut to express this as inequalities, we can write:\n\nFor each i, - (a\u2081_i + a\u2082_i) \u2264 x_i \u2264 a\u2081_i + a\u2082_i.\n\nBut wait, that might not be accurate because the coefficients a\u2081_i and a\u2082_i could be negative, so the inequalities might not directly translate. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the inequalities that bound each component.\n\nAlternatively, since S is the Minkowski sum, it can be represented as the set of all x such that x is in the convex hull of the line segments along a\u2081 and a\u2082. \n\nBut perhaps a more straightforward way is to consider that S is the set of all points x that can be written as x = y\u2081a\u2081 + y\u2082a\u2082 with y\u2081, y\u2082 \u2208 [-1, 1]. \n\nTo express this in the form Ax \u2264 b and Fx = g, we can consider the inequalities that arise from the maximum and minimum values of each component.\n\nFor each component i, the maximum value of x_i is achieved when y\u2081 = 1 and y\u2082 = 1, so x_i \u2264 a\u2081_i + a\u2082_i.\n\nSimilarly, the minimum value of x_i is achieved when y\u2081 = -1 and y\u2082 = -1, so x_i \u2265 -a\u2081_i - a\u2082_i.\n\nBut wait, that's not quite right because y\u2081 and y\u2082 are independent, so for each component, the maximum and minimum are determined by the maximum and minimum of the linear combination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that for each component i, x_i is bounded by the maximum and minimum of y\u2081a\u2081_i + y\u2082a\u2082_i over y\u2081, y\u2082 \u2208 [-1, 1].\n\nThe maximum of y\u2081a\u2081_i + y\u2082a\u2082_i is achieved when y\u2081 and y\u2082 are chosen to maximize this expression. Since y\u2081 and y\u2082 are independent, the maximum occurs when y\u2081 = 1 and y\u2082 = 1 if a\u2081_i and a\u2082_i are positive, or when y\u2081 = -1 and y\u2082 = -1 if they are negative. \n\nBut this might complicate things. Instead, perhaps it's better to consider that S is the set of all x such that x can be expressed as a linear combination of a\u2081 and a\u2082 with coefficients between -1 and 1. \n\nIn terms of linear inequalities, this can be represented as:\n\n- For each i, x_i \u2264 a\u2081_i + a\u2082_i\n- For each i, x_i \u2265 -a\u2081_i - a\u2082_i\n\nBut wait, that might not capture all the inequalities because depending on the direction of a\u2081 and a\u2082, the maximum and minimum could be different. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that S is the set of all x such that x is in the convex hull of the four points when y\u2081 and y\u2082 are at their extremes.\n\nBut perhaps a more precise way is to note that S is the set of all x such that x = y\u2081a\u2081 + y\u2082a\u2082 with y\u2081, y\u2082 \u2208 [-1, 1]. \n\nTo express this in the form Ax \u2264 b and Fx = g, we can consider the following:\n\nEach y\u2081 and y\u2082 is bounded by -1 \u2264 y\u2081 \u2264 1 and -1 \u2264 y\u2082 \u2264 1. So, we can write:\n\n- y\u2081 \u2264 1\n- y\u2081 \u2265 -1\n- y\u2082 \u2264 1\n- y\u2082 \u2265 -1\n\nBut S is a linear combination of a\u2081 and a\u2082 with these y's. So, perhaps we can write inequalities for each component of x.\n\nAlternatively, since S is the Minkowski sum, it's a convex set, and it's bounded by the maximum and minimum values in each direction. \n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to consider that S is the set of all x such that x can be expressed as a linear combination of a\u2081 and a\u2082 with coefficients in [-1, 1]. \n\nTo express this as a system of inequalities, we can note that for each component i, x_i is bounded by the maximum and minimum of y\u2081a\u2081_i + y\u2082a\u2082_i over y\u2081, y\u2082 \u2208 [-1, 1].\n\nThe maximum of y\u2081a\u2081_i + y\u2082a\u2082_i occurs when y\u2081 and y\u2082 are chosen to maximize this expression. Since y\u2081 and y\u2082 are independent, the maximum is achieved when y\u2081 = 1 and y"
