[HUL93, volume 1, page 93] The set {x | x + S_2 \u2286 S_1}, where S_1, S_2 \u2286 R^n with S_1 convex.\n<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c>\n<think>\n<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this problem here: I need to determine which of the given sets are convex. The set in question is {x | x + S\u2082 \u2286 S\u2081}, where S\u2081 and S\u2082 are subsets of R\u207f, and it's given that S\u2081 is convex. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that a set is convex if, for any two points in the set, the line segment connecting them is entirely contained within the set. So, if I can show that for any two points x and y in the set {x | x + S\u2082 \u2286 S\u2081}, the point (1 - \u03bb)x + \u03bby is also in the set for any \u03bb between 0 and 1, then the set is convex.\n\nLet me denote the set we're interested in as A, so A = {x | x + S\u2082 \u2286 S\u2081}. I need to check if A is convex.\n\nTo check convexity, I should take any two points x and y in A and see if the point z = (1 - \u03bb)x + \u03bby is also in A for any \u03bb \u2208 [0,1]. That means I need to verify that z + S\u2082 \u2286 S\u2081.\n\nSo, let's take an arbitrary point z = (1 - \u03bb)x + \u03bby. Since x and y are in A, we know that x + S\u2082 \u2286 S\u2081 and y + S\u2082 \u2286 S\u2081.\n\nNow, I need to show that for any s\u2082 \u2208 S\u2082, z + s\u2082 is in S\u2081. Let's compute z + s\u2082:\n\nz + s\u2082 = (1 - \u03bb)x + \u03bby + s\u2082 = (1 - \u03bb)(x + s\u2082) + \u03bb(y + s\u2082)\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check:\n\nNo, that's not quite right. Let me factor out the terms properly. Let's see:\n\nz + s\u2082 = (1 - \u03bb)x + \u03bby + s\u2082 = (1 - \u03bb)(x) + \u03bb(y) + s\u2082\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor this differently. Let's consider that x + S\u2082 \u2286 S\u2081, so for any s\u2082 \u2208 S\u2082, x + s\u2082 \u2208 S\u2081. Similarly, y + S\u2082 \u2286 S\u2081, so y + s\u2082 \u2208 S\u2081.\n\nSo, z + s\u2082 = (1 - \u03bb)x + \u03bby + s\u2082. Let me rearrange this:\n\n= (1 - \u03bb)(x) + \u03bb(y) + s\u2082\n\nBut I can also write this as:\n\n= (1 - \u03bb)(x + s\u2082) + \u03bb(y + s\u2082) - (1 - \u03bb)s\u2082 + \u03bb s\u2082\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Maybe another approach. Let's consider that since x + S\u2082 \u2286 S\u2081, then for any s\u2082 \u2208 S\u2082, x + s\u2082 \u2208 S\u2081. Similarly, y + s\u2082 \u2208 S\u2081.\n\nSo, z + s\u2082 = (1 - \u03bb)x + \u03bby + s\u2082. Let's factor out the terms:\n\n= (1 - \u03bb)(x) + \u03bb(y) + s\u2082\n\nBut since x + S\u2082 \u2286 S\u2081, we can write x + s\u2082 \u2208 S\u2081 for any s\u2082 \u2208 S\u2082. Similarly, y + s\u2082 \u2208 S\u2081.\n\nWait, maybe I can express z + s\u2082 in terms of x + s\u2082 and y + s\u2082. Let me see:\n\nz + s\u2082 = (1 - \u03bb)x + \u03bby + s\u2082 = (1 - \u03bb)(x + s\u2082) + \u03bb(y + s\u2082) - (1 - \u03bb)s\u2082 + \u03bb s\u2082\n\nWait, that seems messy. Maybe a better approach is to note that since x + S\u2082 \u2286 S\u2081, then for any s\u2082 \u2208 S\u2082, x + s\u2082 \u2208 S\u2081. Similarly, y + s\u2082 \u2208 S\u2081.\n\nSo, z + s\u2082 = (1 - \u03bb)x + \u03bby + s\u2082. Let's factor this as:\n\n= (1 - \u03bb)(x + s\u2082) + \u03bb(y + s\u2082) - (1 - \u03bb)s\u2082 + \u03bb s\u2082\n\nWait, that's not helpful. Maybe I should think differently. Let's consider that since x + S\u2082 \u2286 S\u2081, then for any s\u2082 \u2208 S\u2082, x + s\u2082 \u2208 S\u2081. Similarly, y + s\u2082 \u2208 S\u2081.\n\nSo, z + s\u2082 = (1 - \u03bb)x + \u03bby + s\u2082. Let's factor this as:\n\n= (1 - \u03bb)(x) + \u03bb(y) + s\u2082\n\nBut since x + S\u2082 \u2286 S\u2081, then (1 - \u03bb)x + \u03bby + s\u2082 can be written as (1 - \u03bb)(x + s\u2082) + \u03bb(y + s\u2082) - (1 - \u03bb)s\u2082 + \u03bb s\u2082. Hmm, maybe that's not the right way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write z + s\u2082 as:\n\nz + s\u2082 = (1 - \u03bb)x + \u03bby + s\u2082 = (1 - \u03bb)(x + s\u2082) + \u03bb(y + s\u2082) - (1 - \u03bb)s\u2082 + \u03bb s\u2082\n\nWait, that seems too convoluted. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nLet me consider that since x + S\u2082 \u2286 S\u2081, then for any s\u2082 \u2208 S\u2082, x + s\u2082 \u2208 S\u2081. Similarly, y + s\u2082 \u2208 S\u2081.\n\nSo, z + s\u2082 = (1 - \u03bb)x + \u03bby + s\u2082. Let's factor this as:\n\n= (1 - \u03bb)(x) + \u03bb(y) + s\u2082\n\nBut since x + S\u2082 \u2286 S\u2081, then (1 - \u03bb)x + \u03bby + s\u2082 can be expressed as (1 - \u03bb)(x + s\u2082) + \u03bb(y + s\u2082) - (1 - \u03bb)s\u2082 + \u03bb s\u2082. Wait, that seems incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it as:\n\nz + s\u2082 = (1 - \u03bb)x + \u03bby + s\u2082 = (1 - \u03bb)(x + s\u2082) + \u03bb(y + s\u2082) - (1 - \u03bb)s\u2082 + \u03bb s\u2082\n\nWait, that's not correct because (1 - \u03bb)(x + s\u2082) + \u03bb(y + s\u2082) = (1 - \u03bb)x + (1 - \u03bb)s\u2082 + \u03bb y + \u03bb s\u2082 = (1 - \u03bb)x + \u03bb y + s\u2082, which is exactly z + s\u2082. So, that works.\n\nTherefore, z + s\u2082 = (1 - \u03bb)(x + s\u2082) + \u03bb(y + s\u2082). Since x + S\u2082 \u2286 S\u2081 and y + S\u2082 \u2286 S\u2081, both x + s\u2082 and y + s\u2082 are in S\u2081 for any s\u2082 \u2208 S\u2082.\n\nNow, since S\u2081 is convex, the line segment between any two points in S\u2081 is also in S\u2081. So, for any \u03bb \u2208 [0,1], (1 - \u03bb)(x + s\u2082) + \u03bb(y + s\u2082) \u2208 S\u2081.\n\nTherefore, z + s\u2082 \u2208 S\u2081 for any s\u2082 \u2208 S\u2082. Since this holds for any s\u2082 \u2208 S\u2082, it follows that z + S\u2082 \u2286 S\u2081.\n\nThus, z is in A. Since this holds for any x and y in A and any \u03bb \u2208 [0,1], the set A is convex.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. I think I might have made a mistake in the algebra. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me consider that for any s\u2082 \u2208 S\u2082, x + s\u2082 \u2208 S\u2081 and y + s\u2082 \u2208 S\u2081. So, z + s\u2082 = (1 - \u03bb)x + \u03bby + s\u2082. Let's factor this as:\n\nz + s\u2082 = (1 - \u03bb)(x + s\u2082) + \u03bb(y + s\u2082)\n\nSince x + s\u2082 and y + s\u2082 are in S\u2081, and S\u2081 is convex, then any convex combination of points in S\u2081 is also in S\u2081. Therefore, (1 - \u03bb)(x + s\u2082) + \u03bb(y + s\u2082) \u2208 S\u2081.\n\nThus, z + s\u2082 \u2208 S\u2081 for any s\u2082 \u2208 S\u2082, which means z + S\u2082 \u2286 S\u2081. Therefore, z is in A. So, A is convex.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the set A is convex because for any two points x and y in A, and any \u03bb \u2208 [0,1], the point z = (1 - \u03bb)x + \u03bby is also in A.\n\nTherefore, the set {x | x + S\u2082 \u2286 S\u2081} is convex.\n</think>\n\nThe set {x | x + S\u2082 \u2286 S\u2081} is convex because for any two points x and y in the set and any \u03bb \u2208 [0,1], the point z = (1 - \u03bb)x + \u03bby satisfies z + S\u2082 \u2286 S\u2081. Thus, the set is convex.\n\n**Answer:** The set {x | x + S\u2082 \u2286 S\u2081} is convex."
