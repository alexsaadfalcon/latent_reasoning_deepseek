    "problem": "Derive the conjugates of the following functions. Negative generalized logarithm for second-order cone. f(x,t) = -log(t^2 - x^T x) on {(x,t) \u2208 R^n \u00d7 R | ||x||_2 < t}.",
    "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the conjugate of the function f(x, t) = -log(t\u00b2 - x\u1d40x) defined on the set {(x, t) \u2208 \u211d\u207f \u00d7 \u211d | ||x||\u2082 < t}. Hmm, the conjugate of a function is a standard concept in convex analysis, right? The conjugate function f*(y, s) is defined as the supremum over all (x, t) of the inner product of (y, s) with (x, t) minus f(x, t). So, mathematically, it's:\n\nf*(y, s) = sup_{(x,t)} [y\u00b7x + s\u00b7t - (-log(t\u00b2 - x\u1d40x))] = sup_{(x,t)} [y\u00b7x + s\u00b7t + log(t\u00b2 - x\u1d40x)]\n\nAlright, so I need to maximize y\u00b7x + s\u00b7t + log(t\u00b2 - x\u1d40x) over all x and t such that ||x||\u2082 < t. Let me write that down:\n\nf*(y, s) = sup_{||x||\u2082 < t} [y\u00b7x + s\u00b7t + log(t\u00b2 - x\u1d40x)]\n\nHmm, this looks like a maximization problem with two variables, x and t. Maybe I can fix t and then maximize over x, and then find the optimal t. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, fix t. Then, for a fixed t, the expression becomes:\n\ny\u00b7x + s\u00b7t + log(t\u00b2 - x\u1d40x)\n\nI can treat this as a function of x, with t fixed. Let me denote this as g(x) = y\u00b7x + log(t\u00b2 - x\u1d40x). So, I need to maximize g(x) over x with ||x||\u2082 < t.\n\nWait, but t is also a variable here. So, for each t, I have to maximize g(x) over x with ||x||\u2082 < t, and then take the supremum over t.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers to maximize g(x) + log(t\u00b2 - x\u1d40x) with respect to x and t. Let me set up the Lagrangian:\n\nL(x, t, \u03bb) = y\u00b7x + s\u00b7t + log(t\u00b2 - x\u1d40x) - \u03bb(||x||\u2082 - t)\n\nWait, but actually, the constraint is ||x||\u2082 < t, so maybe it's better to write it as t \u2265 ||x||\u2082. So, the Lagrangian would be:\n\nL(x, t, \u03bb) = y\u00b7x + s\u00b7t + log(t\u00b2 - x\u1d40x) - \u03bb(t - ||x||\u2082)\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right way. Alternatively, maybe I can consider t as a variable and x as a variable, and use calculus to find the maximum.\n\nLet me try taking partial derivatives with respect to x and t.\n\nFirst, compute the partial derivative of g(x) with respect to x:\n\ndg/dx = y + (1/(t\u00b2 - x\u1d40x)) * (-2x) = y - (2x)/(t\u00b2 - x\u1d40x)\n\nSimilarly, the partial derivative of log(t\u00b2 - x\u1d40x) with respect to x is:\n\nd/dx [log(t\u00b2 - x\u1d40x)] = (1/(t\u00b2 - x\u1d40x)) * (-2x) = -2x/(t\u00b2 - x\u1d40x)\n\nAnd the partial derivative of log(t\u00b2 - x\u1d40x) with respect to t is:\n\nd/dt [log(t\u00b2 - x\u1d40x)] = (2t)/(t\u00b2 - x\u1d40x)\n\nSo, putting it all together, the partial derivatives of the Lagrangian L with respect to x and t should be zero at the maximum.\n\nWait, but actually, since we're maximizing over x and t, the partial derivatives should be zero. So, let's set up the equations:\n\n\u2202L/\u2202x = y - (2x)/(t\u00b2 - x\u1d40x) + (2x)/(t\u00b2 - x\u1d40x) = y = 0\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the Lagrangian. Let me try again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the Lagrangian as:\n\nL(x, t, \u03bb) = y\u00b7x + s\u00b7t + log(t\u00b2 - x\u1d40x) - \u03bb(t - ||x||\u2082)\n\nThen, taking partial derivatives:\n\n\u2202L/\u2202x = y - (2x)/(t\u00b2 - x\u1d40x) - \u03bb * (x / ||x||\u2082) = 0\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me compute each term properly.\n\nThe derivative of y\u00b7x with respect to x is y.\n\nThe derivative of s\u00b7t with respect to x is 0.\n\nThe derivative of log(t\u00b2 - x\u1d40x) with respect to x is (1/(t\u00b2 - x\u1d40x)) * (-2x) = -2x/(t\u00b2 - x\u1d40x).\n\nThe derivative of -\u03bb(t - ||x||\u2082) with respect to x is -\u03bb * (x / ||x||\u2082).\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\n\u2202L/\u2202x = y - (2x)/(t\u00b2 - x\u1d40x) - (\u03bb x)/||x||\u2082 = 0\n\nSimilarly, the partial derivative with respect to t is:\n\n\u2202L/\u2202t = s + (2t)/(t\u00b2 - x\u1d40x) - \u03bb = 0\n\nAnd the partial derivative with respect to \u03bb is:\n\n\u2202L/\u2202\u03bb = -(t - ||x||\u2082) = 0 \u21d2 t = ||x||\u2082\n\nWait, that's a key point. So, from the partial derivative with respect to \u03bb, we get t = ||x||\u2082.\n\nSo, t is equal to the norm of x. That's an important condition.\n\nNow, substituting t = ||x||\u2082 into the other equations.\n\nSo, let's substitute t = ||x||\u2082 into the partial derivatives.\n\nFirst, the partial derivative with respect to x:\n\ny - (2x)/(t\u00b2 - x\u1d40x) - (\u03bb x)/||x||\u2082 = 0\n\nBut t = ||x||\u2082, so t\u00b2 = ||x||\u2082\u00b2 = x\u1d40x.\n\nSo, t\u00b2 - x\u1d40x = 0. Wait, that would make the denominator zero, which is a problem. Hmm, that suggests that maybe the maximum occurs at the boundary, i.e., when t = ||x||\u2082, but perhaps we can't have t = ||x||\u2082 because that would make the argument of the log zero, which is undefined.\n\nWait, so maybe the maximum occurs when t approaches ||x||\u2082 from above, but that might not be feasible. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when t = ||x||\u2082, but then the log term becomes log(0), which is negative infinity, so that can't be the case.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the Lagrangian. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of using Lagrange multipliers, I can try to express the problem in terms of variables u = x and v = t, and then try to maximize y\u00b7u + s\u00b7v + log(v\u00b2 - u\u1d40u) subject to v \u2265 ||u||\u2082.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the method of completing the square or some substitution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the expression y\u00b7u + s\u00b7v + log(v\u00b2 - u\u1d40u) and try to find its maximum over u and v with v \u2265 ||u||\u2082.\n\nLet me try to fix v and then maximize over u.\n\nSo, for a fixed v, the expression becomes y\u00b7u + log(v\u00b2 - u\u1d40u) + s\u00b7v.\n\nLet me denote this as g(u) = y\u00b7u + log(v\u00b2 - u\u1d40u).\n\nTo maximize g(u), I can take the derivative with respect to u and set it to zero.\n\ndg/du = y + (1/(v\u00b2 - u\u1d40u)) * (-2u) = 0\n\nSo, y - (2u)/(v\u00b2 - u\u1d40u) = 0 \u21d2 y = (2u)/(v\u00b2 - u\u1d40u)\n\nLet me denote u as a vector, so u = [u\u2081, u\u2082, ..., u\u2099]^T.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\ny = (2u)/(v\u00b2 - u\u1d40u)\n\nLet me denote u\u1d40u = ||u||\u2082\u00b2 = r\u00b2, so r = ||u||\u2082.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\ny = (2u)/(v\u00b2 - r\u00b2)\n\nSo, u = (y/2) * (v\u00b2 - r\u00b2) / ||y/2||\u2082\u00b2\n\nWait, but this seems a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can express u in terms of y and r.\n\nWait, let me square both sides to eliminate the denominator.\n\nu = (2y)/(v\u00b2 - r\u00b2)\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me try again.\n\nFrom y = (2u)/(v\u00b2 - r\u00b2), we can write:\n\nu = (y/2) * (v\u00b2 - r\u00b2)\n\nBut this seems like a vector equation, so perhaps I can take the norm squared on both sides.\n\n||u||\u2082\u00b2 = || (y/2) * (v\u00b2 - r\u00b2) ||\u2082\u00b2\n\nBut wait, (v\u00b2 - r\u00b2) is a scalar, so this would be (y/2)\u00b2 * (v\u00b2 - r\u00b2)\u00b2.\n\nBut also, ||u||\u2082\u00b2"
