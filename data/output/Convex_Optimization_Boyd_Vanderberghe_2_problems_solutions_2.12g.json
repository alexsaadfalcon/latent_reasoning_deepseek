You can assume a \u2260 b and 0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 1.\n<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c>\n<think>\n<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine which of the given sets are convex. The set in question is defined as {x | ||x - a||_2 \u2264 \u03b8||x - b||_2}, where a and b are distinct points (since a \u2260 b) and \u03b8 is a fixed fraction between 0 and 1. \n\nFirst, I should recall what a convex set is. A set is convex if, for any two points within the set, the line segment connecting them is entirely contained within the set. So, I need to check if for any two points x and y in the set, the point z = (1 - \u03bb)x + \u03bby is also in the set for all \u03bb between 0 and 1.\n\nLet me write down the condition for the set: ||x - a||_2 \u2264 \u03b8||x - b||_2. I need to see if this condition holds for any z on the line segment between x and y.\n\nLet me express z as z = (1 - \u03bb)x + \u03bby. Then, I need to check if ||z - a||_2 \u2264 \u03b8||z - b||_2.\n\nExpanding ||z - a||_2, we get ||(1 - \u03bb)x + \u03bby - a||_2. Similarly, ||z - b||_2 is ||(1 - \u03bb)x + \u03bby - b||_2.\n\nI can rewrite these as ||(1 - \u03bb)(x - a) + \u03bb(y - a)||_2 and ||(1 - \u03bb)(x - b) + \u03bb(y - b)||_2, respectively.\n\nSince the norm is a convex function, I can use the triangle inequality. The triangle inequality states that ||u + v||_2 \u2264 ||u||_2 + ||v||_2. But I need to see if the inequality holds in the reverse direction, which is what convexity requires.\n\nWait, actually, convexity requires that for any \u03bb in [0,1], ||(1 - \u03bb)x + \u03bby - a||_2 \u2264 \u03b8|| (1 - \u03bb)x + \u03bby - b||_2.\n\nLet me denote u = x - a and v = y - a. Then, z - a = (1 - \u03bb)u + \u03bbv. Similarly, z - b = (1 - \u03bb)(x - b) + \u03bb(y - b) = (1 - \u03bb)(u - (b - a)) + \u03bb(v - (b - a)).\n\nWait, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, since a \u2260 b, I can express the condition in terms of the difference between x and b.\n\nLet me consider the ratio of the distances: ||x - a||_2 / ||x - b||_2 \u2264 \u03b8. I need to see if this ratio is maintained along the line segment between x and y.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can manipulate the inequality directly. Let's square both sides to eliminate the square roots, but I have to be careful because squaring inequalities can be tricky.\n\nStarting with ||x - a||_2 \u2264 \u03b8||x - b||_2.\n\nSquaring both sides: ||x - a||_2\u00b2 \u2264 \u03b8\u00b2 ||x - b||_2\u00b2.\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\n(x - a)\u00b7(x - a) \u2264 \u03b8\u00b2 (x - b)\u00b7(x - b).\n\nWhich is:\n\nx\u00b7x - 2a\u00b7x + a\u00b7a \u2264 \u03b8\u00b2 (x\u00b7x - 2b\u00b7x + b\u00b7b).\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\nx\u00b7x - 2a\u00b7x + a\u00b7a - \u03b8\u00b2 x\u00b7x + 2\u03b8\u00b2 b\u00b7x - \u03b8\u00b2 b\u00b7b \u2264 0.\n\nFactor x\u00b7x terms:\n\n(1 - \u03b8\u00b2) x\u00b7x + (-2a + 2\u03b8\u00b2 b)\u00b7x + (a\u00b7a - \u03b8\u00b2 b\u00b7b) \u2264 0.\n\nThis is a quadratic inequality in x. For the set to be convex, this inequality must hold for all x in the set, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should consider the condition for convexity directly.\n\nAnother approach: Let's take two points x and y in the set. Then, for any \u03bb \u2208 [0,1], z = (1 - \u03bb)x + \u03bby must also be in the set. So, we need to verify if ||z - a||_2 \u2264 \u03b8 ||z - b||_2.\n\nExpressing z as (1 - \u03bb)x + \u03bby, we can write:\n\n|| (1 - \u03bb)x + \u03bby - a ||_2 \u2264 \u03b8 || (1 - \u03bb)x + \u03bby - b ||_2.\n\nLet me denote u = x - a and v = y - a. Then, z - a = (1 - \u03bb)u + \u03bbv.\n\nSimilarly, z - b = (1 - \u03bb)(x - b) + \u03bb(y - b) = (1 - \u03bb)(u - (b - a)) + \u03bb(v - (b - a)).\n\nWait, maybe that's not the most straightforward way. Alternatively, let's express z - a and z - b in terms of x and y.\n\nz - a = (1 - \u03bb)x + \u03bby - a = (1 - \u03bb)(x - a) + \u03bb(y - a).\n\nSimilarly, z - b = (1 - \u03bb)(x - b) + \u03bb(y - b).\n\nBut since a \u2260 b, we can write y - b = (y - a) + (a - b). So, z - b = (1 - \u03bb)(x - a) + \u03bb(y - a) + \u03bb(a - b).\n\nHmm, this might not be helpful. Maybe instead, I can consider the ratio of the distances.\n\nLet me consider the ratio ||z - a||_2 / ||z - b||_2. If this ratio is always \u2264 \u03b8, then z is in the set.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the function f(x) = ||x - a||_2 / ||x - b||_2. If this function is convex, then the set {x | f(x) \u2264 \u03b8} would be convex.\n\nWait, but f(x) is a ratio of norms, which is not necessarily convex. However, maybe I can analyze it differently.\n\nLet me consider two points x and y in the set. Then, for any \u03bb \u2208 [0,1], I need to check if f(z) \u2264 \u03b8, where z = (1 - \u03bb)x + \u03bby.\n\nSo, f(z) = ||z - a||_2 / ||z - b||_2.\n\nI need to see if this is \u2264 \u03b8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the triangle inequality or some other property.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to consider specific cases. Let me take \u03b8 = 1. Then, the set is {x | ||x - a||_2 \u2264 ||x - b||_2}. This is the set of points closer to a than to b, which is the half-space defined by the perpendicular bisector of a and b. This is a convex set because it's a linear inequality.\n\nNow, what about \u03b8 < 1? Let's say \u03b8 = 0.5. Then, the set is {x | ||x - a||_2 \u2264 0.5 ||x - b||_2}. I need to check if this is convex.\n\nLet me pick two points x and y in this set. Then, I need to check if the midpoint z = (x + y)/2 is also in the set.\n\nCompute ||z - a||_2 and ||z - b||_2.\n\nUsing the triangle inequality:\n\n||z - a||_2 = ||(x + y)/2 - a||_2 = ||(x - a + y - a)/2||_2 \u2264 (||x - a||_2 + ||y - a||_2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, ||z - b||_2 = ||(x + y)/2 - b||_2 = ||(x - b + y - b)/2||_2 \u2264 (||x - b||_2 + ||y - b||_2)/2.\n\nGiven that x and y are in the set, we have ||x - a||_2 \u2264 \u03b8 ||x - b||_2 and ||y - a||_2 \u2264 \u03b8 ||y - b||_2.\n\nSo, adding these two inequalities:\n\n||x - a||_2 + ||y - a||_2 \u2264 \u03b8(||x - b||_2 + ||y - b||_2).\n\nDividing both sides by 2:\n\n(||x - a||_2 + ||y - a||_2)/2 \u2264 \u03b8(||x - b||_2 + ||y - b||_2)/2.\n\nFrom earlier, we have:\n\n||z - a||_2 \u2264 (||x - a||_2 + ||y - a||_2)/2 \u2264 \u03b8(||x - b||_2 + ||y - b||_2)/2 \u2264 \u03b8(||z - b||_2).\n\nWait, that seems to suggest that ||z - a||_2 \u2264 \u03b8 ||z - b||_2, which would mean z is in the set. So, the set is convex.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if this is always true. Let me test with specific points.\n\nSuppose a = (0,0) and b = (2,0). Let \u03b8 = 0.5.\n\nTake x ="
