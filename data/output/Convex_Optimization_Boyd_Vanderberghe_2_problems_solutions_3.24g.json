    "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether certain functions of the probability vector p are convex, concave, quasiconvex, or quasiconcave. The probability simplex is defined as all vectors p in R^n where each component is non-negative and the sum of all components is 1. \n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a random variable x that takes values a\u2081, a\u2082, ..., a\u2099 with probabilities p\u2081, p\u2082, ..., p\u2099 respectively. Each a\u1d62 is ordered such that a\u2081 < a\u2082 < ... < a\u2099. The function we're looking at is a function of p, and we need to classify it as convex, concave, quasiconvex, or quasiconcave.\n\nThe problem mentions two parts: the first part is about determining the type of function, and the second part is about the cardinality of the smallest set A \u2286 {a\u2081, ..., a\u2099} with probability at least 90%. But since the second part is about cardinality, maybe that's a separate question, but the first part is about the function's properties. Hmm, the original problem statement is a bit unclear. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original problem says: \"For each of the following functions of p (on the probability simplex {p \u2208 R^n\u208a | 1^T p = 1}), determine if the function is convex, concave, quasiconvex, or quasiconcave.\" So, it's about the functions of p, not the cardinality. So, maybe the second part is a separate question, but the user is asking me to solve the first part. So, I need to focus on the first part.\n\nBut the user wrote: \"The cardinality of the smallest set A \u2286 {a\u2081, ..., a\u2099} with probability \u2265 90%. (By cardinality we mean the number of elements in A.)\" So, perhaps the problem is to find the minimal size of such a set A, but the user is asking me to solve the first part. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to analyze the function f(p) = min_{A \u2286 {a\u2081, ..., a\u2099}, |A| \u2265 90%} max_{a \u2208 A} a. Or maybe it's the probability that x is in A, which is the sum of p\u1d62 for a\u1d62 in A. But the problem says \"cardinality of the smallest set A \u2286 {a\u2081, ..., a\u2099} with probability \u2265 90%.\" So, it's the minimal size of A such that the probability of x being in A is at least 90%. So, that's a different function.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"For each of the following functions of p (on the probability simplex {p \u2208 R^n\u208a | 1^T p = 1}), determine if the function is convex, concave, quasiconvex, or quasiconcave.\" So, it's about functions of p, not about the cardinality. So, maybe the second part is a separate question, but the user is asking me to solve the first part. Hmm, perhaps I need to focus on the first part.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to analyze the function f(p) = min_{A \u2286 {a\u2081, ..., a\u2099}, |A| \u2265 90%} max_{a \u2208 A} a. So, for each p, f(p) is the minimal maximum a\u1d62 such that at least 90% of the probability is concentrated on the a\u1d62's in A. So, that function is a kind of quantile function, but instead of quantiles, it's the minimal maximum such that the probability is at least 90%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the probability that x is in A, which is the sum of p\u1d62 for a\u1d62 in A. So, that function is linear in p, since it's a sum of p\u1d62's. But that's a linear function, which is both convex and concave, but also quasiconvex and quasiconcave. But I don't think that's the case here because the problem is about functions of p, so maybe it's not linear.\n\nWait, perhaps the function is the probability that x is in A, which is the sum of p\u1d62 for a\u1d62 in A. So, for example, if A is a singleton {a_k}, then the function is p_k. If A is a set of two elements, it's p_i + p_j, and so on. So, the function is a sum of some subset of p's. So, depending on the subset, the function can vary.\n\nBut the problem is to determine if such a function is convex, concave, etc. So, perhaps the function is the minimal maximum a\u1d62 such that the probability is at least 90%. That is, f(p) = min_{A: |A| \u2265 90%} max_{a \u2208 A} a. So, for a given p, f(p) is the smallest maximum a\u1d62 such that at least 90% of the probability is on the a\u1d62's in A.\n\nAlternatively, if it's the probability that x is in A, then it's a sum of p's, which is a convex function because it's a linear combination of convex functions (each p_i is convex, being an indicator function). But wait, p is a probability vector, so each p_i is a convex function on the simplex? Wait, no, p is a vector in the simplex, so it's a point in R^n, but each p_i is a linear function on the simplex.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the function f(p) = min_{A: |A| \u2265 90%} max_{a \u2208 A} a. So, for each p, f(p) is the minimal maximum a\u1d62 such that the probability of x being in A is at least 90%. So, for example, if p is such that all a\u1d62's are above a certain threshold, then f(p) would be the smallest a\u1d62 that is above that threshold.\n\nAlternatively, if p is such that the probability of x being in A is at least 90%, then f(p) is the minimal maximum a\u1d62 in A. So, for example, if p is concentrated on a single a\u1d62, then f(p) is a\u1d62. If p is spread out, then f(p) would be the smallest a\u1d62 that has a cumulative probability of at least 90%.\n\nSo, to analyze whether f(p) is convex, concave, etc., we need to see how f(p) behaves as p changes.\n\nLet me consider the function f(p) = min_{A: |A| \u2265 90%} max_{a \u2208 A} a. So, for each p, f(p) is the smallest a\u1d62 such that the probability of x being in {a\u1d62} is at least 90%. Wait, no, it's the smallest a\u1d62 such that the probability of x being in A is at least 90%, where A is the set of a\u1d62's with probability at least 90% in p.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the function f(p) = min_{A: |A| \u2265 90%} max_{a \u2208 A} a. So, for a given p, f(p) is the minimal maximum a\u1d62 such that the probability of x being in A is at least 90%. So, for example, if p is such that all a\u1d62's are above a certain threshold, then f(p) would be the smallest a\u1d62 that is above that threshold.\n\nAlternatively, if p is such that the probability of x being in A is at least 90%, then f(p) is the minimal maximum a\u1d62 in A.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of f(p) as the smallest a\u1d62 such that the cumulative probability up to a\u1d62 is at least 90%. So, for example, if p is such that a\u2081 has a high probability, then f(p) would be a\u2081. If p is spread out, then f(p) would be the smallest a\u1d62 that has a cumulative probability of at least 90%.\n\nSo, to analyze whether f(p) is convex, concave, etc., we can consider how f(p) changes as p changes.\n\nLet me consider the function f(p) = min_{A: |A| \u2265 90%} max_{a \u2208 A} a. So, for each p, f(p) is the minimal maximum a\u1d62 such that the probability of x being in A is at least 90%.\n\nAlternatively, f(p) can be thought of as the smallest a\u1d62 such that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) at a\u1d62 is at least 90%. So, for example, if p is such that a\u2081 has a CDF of 0.9, then f(p) = a\u2081. If p is such that a\u2081 has a CDF of 0.8 and a\u2082 has a CDF of 0.9, then f(p) = a\u2082.\n\nSo, in general, f(p) is the smallest a\u1d62 such that the CDF at a\u1d62 is at least 90%. So, f(p) is essentially the 90th percentile of the distribution p.\n\nWait, that's an interesting observation"
