    "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether the function f(x\u2081, x\u2082) = 1/(x\u2081x\u2082) is convex, concave, quasiconvex, or quasiconcave on R\u00b2\u208a\u208a. Hmm, let me recall what each of these terms means.\n\nFirst, convexity and concavity are properties of functions in a single variable. A function is convex if the line segment between any two points on the function lies above the function, and concave if it lies below. But this function is in two variables, so I think I need to use the Hessian matrix to check for convexity or concavity.\n\nQuasiconvexity and quasiconcavity are a bit trickier. A function is quasiconvex if the preimage of any interval (a, \u221e) is convex. Similarly, quasiconcave is the preimage of (-\u221e, a) being convex. So, I need to check if the regions where f(x\u2081, x\u2082) \u2264 k or \u2265 k are convex for some k.\n\nAlright, let's start with convexity and concavity.\n\nFor a function of two variables, f is convex if the Hessian matrix is positive semi-definite for all x in the domain. Similarly, it's concave if the Hessian is negative semi-definite.\n\nSo, let's compute the Hessian. First, compute the first and second partial derivatives.\n\nf(x\u2081, x\u2082) = 1/(x\u2081x\u2082) = x\u2081^(-1) x\u2082^(-1)\n\nFirst partial derivatives:\nf_x1 = -x\u2082^(-1) x\u2081^(-2) = -1/(x\u2081\u00b2 x\u2082)\nf_x2 = -x\u2081^(-1) x\u2082^(-2) = -1/(x\u2081 x\u2082\u00b2)\n\nSecond partial derivatives:\nf_xx1 = 2/(x\u2081\u00b3 x\u2082)\nf_x2x1 = 2/(x\u2081\u00b3 x\u2082\u00b2)\nf_x1x2 = 2/(x\u2081\u00b2 x\u2082\u00b3)\nf_xx2 = 2/(x\u2081 x\u2082\u00b3)\n\nSo, the Hessian matrix H is:\n\n[ 2/(x\u2081\u00b3 x\u2082)      2/(x\u2081\u00b3 x\u2082\u00b2) ]\n[ 2/(x\u2081\u00b2 x\u2082\u00b3)      2/(x\u2081 x\u2082\u00b3) ]\n\nTo check if H is positive semi-definite, we can check if all the leading principal minors are non-negative.\n\nFirst minor: 2/(x\u2081\u00b3 x\u2082) > 0, since x\u2081, x\u2082 > 0.\n\nSecond minor: determinant of H.\n\nCompute determinant:\n\n(2/(x\u2081\u00b3 x\u2082)) * (2/(x\u2081 x\u2082\u00b3)) - (2/(x\u2081\u00b3 x\u2082\u00b2)) * (2/(x\u2081\u00b2 x\u2082\u00b3))\n\n= (4)/(x\u2081\u2074 x\u2082\u2074) - (4)/(x\u2081\u2075 x\u2082\u2075)\n\n= 4/(x\u2081\u2074 x\u2082\u2074) - 4/(x\u2081\u2075 x\u2082\u2075)\n\nFactor out 4/(x\u2081\u2074 x\u2082\u2074):\n\n= 4/(x\u2081\u2074 x\u2082\u2074) [1 - 1/x\u2081]\n\nSo, determinant is 4/(x\u2081\u2074 x\u2082\u2074) (1 - 1/x\u2081)\n\nNow, since x\u2081 > 0, 1 - 1/x\u2081 can be positive or negative depending on x\u2081.\n\nIf x\u2081 > 1, then 1 - 1/x\u2081 > 0, so determinant is positive.\n\nIf x\u2081 = 1, determinant is zero.\n\nIf x\u2081 < 1, determinant is negative.\n\nTherefore, the Hessian is not positive semi-definite for all x in R\u00b2\u208a\u208a because for x\u2081 < 1, determinant is negative, which would make the Hessian indefinite. Hence, f is not convex.\n\nSimilarly, to check if it's concave, we need the Hessian to be negative semi-definite. But since the Hessian can have both positive and negative eigenvalues (as we saw determinant can be positive or negative), it's not concave either.\n\nSo, f is neither convex nor concave on R\u00b2\u208a\u208a.\n\nNow, moving on to quasiconvexity and quasiconcavity.\n\nQuasiconvexity: The function is quasiconvex if the set {x | f(x) \u2264 k} is convex for all k.\n\nSimilarly, quasiconcave is if {x | f(x) \u2265 k} is convex.\n\nLet me first check quasiconvexity.\n\nTake k = 1. The set {x | 1/(x\u2081x\u2082) \u2264 1} is equivalent to x\u2081x\u2082 \u2265 1.\n\nIs the region x\u2081x\u2082 \u2265 1 convex? Let's see.\n\nTake two points in x\u2081x\u2082 \u2265 1, say (2, 2). Then, the line segment between (2,2) and (3,3) is (2.5, 2.5). x\u2081x\u2082 = 6.25 \u2265 1, so it's in the set.\n\nBut wait, is that always the case? Let me take another point, say (1, 1). The line segment from (1,1) to (2, 2) is (1.5, 1.5). x\u2081x\u2082 = 2.25 \u2265 1, which is still in the set.\n\nWait, but what if I take a point on the boundary, say (1, 1). If I take a point just outside, say (1, 1.1). The line segment from (1,1) to (1,1.1) is (1,1 + t*(0.1)) for t in [0,1]. The x\u2081x\u2082 at t=0.5 is 1*1.05=1.05 \u22651, which is still in the set.\n\nWait, but is there a case where the line segment goes below the boundary? Let me think.\n\nSuppose I have two points (a, b) and (c, d) where a*b =1 and c*d=1. The line segment between them is (a + t(c - a), b + t(d - b)). Let's see if x\u2081x\u2082 can be less than 1 somewhere on this segment.\n\nCompute x\u2081x\u2082(t) = (a + t(c - a))(b + t(d - b)).\n\nWe need to check if this can be less than 1 for some t in (0,1).\n\nBut since both (a,b) and (c,d) are on x\u2081x\u2082=1, which is the boundary. The function x\u2081x\u2082 is convex on the boundary? Wait, not necessarily.\n\nWait, actually, the product x\u2081x\u2082 is a convex function on R\u00b2\u208a\u208a. So, the set x\u2081x\u2082 \u22651 is the epigraph of a convex function, which is convex. So, yes, the set {x | x\u2081x\u2082 \u22651} is convex.\n\nWait, but hold on, is x\u2081x\u2082 convex? Let me check.\n\nCompute the Hessian of x\u2081x\u2082.\n\nFirst partial derivatives:\n\nf_x1 = x\u2082, f_x2 = x\u2081\n\nSecond partial derivatives:\n\nf_xx1 = 0, f_x2x1 = 1, f_x1x2 = 1, f_xx2 = 0\n\nSo, Hessian is:\n\n[0 1]\n[1 0]\n\nWhich is a matrix with eigenvalues 1 and -1. So, it's indefinite, meaning x\u2081x\u2082 is neither convex nor concave on R\u00b2\u208a\u208a. But the set {x | x\u2081x\u2082 \u22651} is convex because it's the epigraph of a convex function.\n\nWait, but the Hessian of x\u2081x\u2082 is indefinite, so x\u2081x\u2082 is not convex or concave, but its epigraph is convex.\n\nSo, in our case, the set {x | f(x) \u22641} is the same as {x | x\u2081x\u2082 \u22651}, which is convex. Therefore, f is quasiconvex.\n\nSimilarly, for quasiconcavity, we need to check if {x | f(x) \u22651} is convex.\n\nBut {x | f(x) \u22651} is {x | x\u2081x\u2082 \u22641}, which is the region below the hyperbola x\u2081x\u2082=1.\n\nIs this region convex?\n\nTake two points in {x | x\u2081x\u2082 \u22641}, say (0.5, 0.5). The line segment from (0.5,0.5) to (1,1) is (0.75, 0.75). x\u2081x\u2082=0.5625 \u22641, which is in the set.\n\nBut take another point, say (0.5, 2). The line segment from (0.5,2) to (1,1) is (0.75, 1.25). x\u2081x\u2082=0.75*1.25=0.9375 \u22641, which is still in the set.\n\nWait, but what about points on the boundary? Let's take (1,1). The line segment from (1,1) to (2,0.5) is (1.5, 0.75). x\u2081x\u2082=1.125 >1, which is outside the set.\n\nWait, but ("
