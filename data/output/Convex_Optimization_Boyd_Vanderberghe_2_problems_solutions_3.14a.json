We say the function f : R^n \u00d7 R^m \u2192 R is convex-concave if f(x, z) is a concave function of z, for each fixed x, and a convex function of x, for each fixed z. We also require its domain to have the product form dom f = A \u00d7 B, where A \u2286 R^n and B \u2286 R^m are convex.

    "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem about convex-concave functions. Let me try to understand what it's asking. The function f is defined from R^n \u00d7 R^m to R, and it's convex-concave. That means for each fixed x, f(x, z) is concave in z, and for each fixed z, f(x, z) is convex in x. Also, the domain of f is the product of two convex sets A and B. \n\nThe task is to find a second-order condition for f to be convex-concave, expressed in terms of its Hessian \u2207\u00b2f(x, z). Hmm, okay. So, I need to figure out what properties the Hessian must satisfy for f to be convex-concave.\n\nFirst, let me recall some definitions. A function is convex-concave if it's both convex in one variable and concave in the other. So, for each x, f(x, z) is concave in z, which means that for any z1, z2 in B and \u03bb \u2208 [0,1], f(x, \u03bbz1 + (1-\u03bb)z2) \u2265 \u03bbf(x, z1) + (1-\u03bb)f(x, z2). Similarly, for each z, f(x, z) is convex in x, so for any x1, x2 in A and \u03bb \u2208 [0,1], f(\u03bbx1 + (1-\u03bb)x2, z) \u2264 \u03bbf(x1, z) + (1-\u03bb)f(x2, z).\n\nSince f is twice differentiable, I can consider its Hessian. The Hessian \u2207\u00b2f(x, z) is a block matrix, right? Because f is a function of two variables, x and z. So, it's a (n + m) \u00d7 (n + m) matrix. Let me denote it as:\n\n\u2207\u00b2f(x, z) = [\u2207\u00b2x f(x, z)  \u2207z f(x, z)\n               \u2207z f(x, z)^T  \u2207\u00b2z f(x, z)]\n\nWhere \u2207\u00b2x f is the Hessian with respect to x, and \u2207\u00b2z f is the Hessian with respect to z. The off-diagonal blocks are the gradients of f with respect to the other variable.\n\nNow, for f to be convex-concave, we need certain properties on these blocks. Let me think about the convexity in x. For f(x, z) to be convex in x, the Hessian \u2207\u00b2x f(x, z) must be positive semi-definite for all x, z. Similarly, for f(x, z) to be concave in z, the Hessian \u2207\u00b2z f(x, z) must be negative semi-definite for all x, z.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for a second-order condition, so maybe it's not just about the Hessian being positive or negative semi-definite, but something more about the relationship between the Hessian blocks.\n\nLet me think about the convexity in x. If f is convex in x, then for any x1, x2 and \u03bb \u2208 [0,1], we have:\n\nf(\u03bbx1 + (1-\u03bb)x2, z) \u2264 \u03bbf(x1, z) + (1-\u03bb)f(x2, z)\n\nTaking second derivatives, the Hessian \u2207\u00b2x f(x, z) must be positive semi-definite. Similarly, for concavity in z, \u2207\u00b2z f(x, z) must be negative semi-definite.\n\nBut the problem is about a second-order condition, so maybe it's about the eigenvalues or something related to the eigenvalues of the Hessian blocks.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the mixed Hessian. Since f is convex-concave, maybe the mixed partial derivatives have some properties.\n\nLet me recall that for a function f(x, z), the mixed partial derivatives f_{xz} and f_{zx} are equal if f is twice differentiable. So, \u2207\u00b2x f and \u2207\u00b2z f are symmetric matrices.\n\nNow, for f to be convex in x, \u2207\u00b2x f must be positive semi-definite. For f to be concave in z, \u2207\u00b2z f must be negative semi-definite.\n\nBut how does this relate to the Hessian \u2207\u00b2f(x, z)? Let me think about the structure of \u2207\u00b2f(x, z). It's a block matrix with blocks \u2207\u00b2x f, \u2207z f, \u2207z f^T, and \u2207\u00b2z f.\n\nIf I consider the block structure, maybe I can derive some conditions on the blocks.\n\nSince f is convex in x, \u2207\u00b2x f is positive semi-definite. Similarly, \u2207\u00b2z f is negative semi-definite.\n\nBut what about the off-diagonal blocks? The gradient \u2207z f is a row vector, and \u2207x f is a column vector. So, the off-diagonal blocks are \u2207z f^T and \u2207x f.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think about the Hessian \u2207\u00b2f(x, z) in terms of its blocks and see what conditions make f convex-concave.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the concept of the second-order directional derivative. For f to be convex-concave, the second-order directional derivative in any direction (u, v) should satisfy certain inequalities.\n\nLet me recall that for a function f, the second-order directional derivative in direction (u, v) is given by:\n\nD\u00b2f(u, v) = \u2207\u00b2f(x, z)[u, v; v, u]\n\nWhich is a 2x2 matrix:\n\n[\u2207\u00b2x f u, \u2207z f u\n \u2207z f^T u, \u2207\u00b2z f u]\n\nSo, for f to be convex-concave, we need that for any (u, v), this matrix is positive semi-definite if f is convex in x, and negative semi-definite if f is concave in z.\n\nWait, but actually, for f to be convex in x, the second-order directional derivative in any direction (u, v) should be positive semi-definite. Similarly, for f to be concave in z, the second-order directional derivative should be negative semi-definite.\n\nBut how does this relate to the Hessian \u2207\u00b2f(x, z)?\n\nLet me think about the structure of \u2207\u00b2f(x, z). It's a block matrix:\n\n[\u2207\u00b2x f  \u2207z f\n \u2207z f^T  \u2207\u00b2z f]\n\nIf I consider the block (1,1) block, which is \u2207\u00b2x f, it needs to be positive semi-definite. Similarly, the block (2,2) is \u2207\u00b2z f, which needs to be negative semi-definite.\n\nBut what about the off-diagonal blocks? The (1,2) block is \u2207z f, and the (2,1) block is \u2207z f^T.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the eigenvalues of the Hessian. If the Hessian is positive semi-definite, then all its eigenvalues are non-negative. If it's negative semi-definite, all eigenvalues are non-positive.\n\nBut the Hessian is a block matrix, so its eigenvalues are not straightforward to compute. However, maybe I can relate the eigenvalues of the Hessian to the eigenvalues of the diagonal blocks.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the condition that the Hessian is positive semi-definite in the x-direction and negative semi-definite in the z-direction, but that might not capture the mixed terms.\n\nWait, another approach: For f to be convex-concave, the function must satisfy certain conditions on its second derivatives. Specifically, for each (x, z), the Hessian \u2207\u00b2f(x, z) must be such that for any (u, v), the matrix [\u2207\u00b2x f u, \u2207z f u; \u2207z f^T u, \u2207\u00b2z f u] is positive semi-definite if f is convex in x, and negative semi-definite if f is concave in z.\n\nBut how does this translate into a condition on the Hessian itself?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the mixed partial derivatives. Since f is twice differentiable, the mixed partial derivatives are equal, so \u2207\u00b2x f and \u2207\u00b2z f are symmetric.\n\nLet me denote the Hessian as:\n\n\u2207\u00b2f = [A  B\n         B^T C]\n\nWhere A = \u2207\u00b2x f, B = \u2207z f, and C = \u2207\u00b2z f.\n\nThen, for f to be convex in x, A must be positive semi-definite. For f to be concave in z, C must be negative semi-definite.\n\nBut what about the off-diagonal blocks? The mixed partial derivatives are B and B^T. So, perhaps the condition is that the mixed partial derivatives satisfy certain inequalities.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the concept of the Hessian being positive semi-definite in the x-direction and negative semi-definite in the z-direction, but that might not capture the mixed terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the condition that the Hessian is positive semi-definite in the x-direction and negative semi-definite in the z-direction, but also that the mixed terms are zero or satisfy some condition.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think about the function f as being separable or not. If f is separable, meaning f(x, z) = g(x) + h(z), then it's both convex in x and concave in z if g is convex and h is concave. But"
