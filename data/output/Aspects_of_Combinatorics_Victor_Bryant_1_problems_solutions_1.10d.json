Think briefly and provide a simple answer in the form of a statement or equation with LaTeX formatting.\nHow many of the $1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \\cdots + n^3$ rectangles are squares?\n<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c>\n<think>\n<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this problem: I need to figure out how many of the rectangles formed by the sum \\(1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \\cdots + n^3\\) are squares. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the sum of cubes formula is a well-known result. The sum \\(1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \\cdots + n^3\\) is equal to \\(\\left( \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\right)^2\\). So, that simplifies the total number of rectangles to a square number. That's interesting because it means the total area is a perfect square.\n\nNow, the question is about how many of these rectangles are actually squares. So, I need to find how many pairs of integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) satisfy \\(a \\times b = \\left( \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\right)^2\\) and \\(a = b\\). In other words, I need to find the number of square factors of \\(\\left( \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\right)^2\\).\n\nWait, but actually, since the total area is a square, any rectangle with area equal to that sum is a square if and only if its sides are equal. So, the number of square rectangles is equal to the number of ways to write the total area as a product of two equal integers. That is, the number of square factors of the total area.\n\nBut the total area is already a square, so all its factors come in pairs. However, the number of square factors is equal to the number of divisors of the square root of the total area. Because if \\(d\\) is a square factor, then \\(\\sqrt{d}\\) is an integer, and \\(d = (\\sqrt{d})^2\\). So, the number of square factors is equal to the number of divisors of \\(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure. If the total area is \\(A = \\left( \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\right)^2\\), then the number of square rectangles is equal to the number of square divisors of \\(A\\). Since \\(A\\) is a square, the number of square divisors is equal to the number of divisors of \\(\\sqrt{A}\\), which is \\(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\).\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of divisors of \\(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\). Because each divisor \\(d\\) of \\(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\) corresponds to a square factor \\(d^2\\) of \\(A\\).\n\nTherefore, the number of square rectangles is equal to the number of divisors of \\(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\).\n\nBut wait, let me think again. If \\(A = \\left( \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\right)^2\\), then the number of square factors is equal to the number of square divisors of \\(A\\). Since \\(A\\) is a square, the number of square divisors is equal to the product of one more than each of the exponents in the prime factorization of \\(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\).\n\nWait, no, actually, the number of square divisors of a number is equal to the product of (floor(exponent/2) + 1) for each prime in its prime factorization. But since \\(A\\) is a square, all exponents in its prime factorization are even. So, the number of square divisors is equal to the product of (exponent/2 + 1) for each prime.\n\nBut since \\(A = \\left( \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\right)^2\\), the number of square divisors is equal to the number of divisors of \\(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\). Because each square divisor \\(d^2\\) of \\(A\\) corresponds to a divisor \\(d\\) of \\(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\).\n\nTherefore, the number of square rectangles is equal to the number of divisors of \\(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\).\n\nBut wait, let me verify this with a small example. Let's take \\(n = 1\\). Then, the sum is \\(1^3 = 1\\), which is a square. The number of square rectangles is 1, which is equal to the number of divisors of \\(\\frac{1 \\times 2}{2} = 1\\). The number of divisors of 1 is 1, so that works.\n\nFor \\(n = 2\\), the sum is \\(1 + 8 = 9\\), which is a square. The number of square rectangles is 1, which is equal to the number of divisors of \\(\\frac{2 \\times 3}{2} = 3\\). The number of divisors of 3 is 2, but wait, that's 2, but the number of square rectangles is 1. Hmm, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recast the problem.\n\nWait, when \\(n = 2\\), the total area is 9, which is a square. So, the number of square rectangles is 1, but the number of divisors of \\(\\frac{2 \\times 3}{2} = 3\\) is 2 (1 and 3). So, that doesn't match. So, my previous reasoning must be flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe the number of square rectangles is equal to the number of ways to write the total area as a square, which is equal to the number of square factors of the total area.\n\nBut in the case of \\(n = 2\\), the total area is 9, which is \\(3^2\\). So, the number of square factors is 3 (1, 3, 9). But the number of square rectangles is 1, because the only square is 3x3. So, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, so perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to think about the number of rectangles that are squares. So, for each square, it's determined by its side length. So, the number of squares is equal to the number of integers \\(k\\) such that \\(k^2\\) divides the total area.\n\nBut the total area is \\(A = \\left( \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\right)^2\\). So, the number of square rectangles is equal to the number of integers \\(k\\) such that \\(k^2\\) divides \\(A\\). Since \\(A\\) is a square, the number of such \\(k\\) is equal to the number of divisors of \\(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\).\n\nWait, but in the case of \\(n = 2\\), \\(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 3\\), which has 2 divisors, but the number of square rectangles is 1. So, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think about the number of squares as the number of square factors, which is equal to the number of square divisors. For \\(A = m^2\\), the number of square divisors is equal to the number of divisors of \\(m\\). So, in this case, \\(m = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\), so the number of square divisors is equal to the number of divisors of \\(m\\).\n\nBut in the case of \\(n = 2\\), \\(m = 3\\), which has 2 divisors, but the number of square rectangles is 1. So, that still doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the number of square factors with the number of square divisors. Let me clarify.\n\nIf \\(A = m^2\\), then the number of square factors is equal to the number of divisors of \\(m\\). Because each divisor \\(d\\) of \\(m\\) corresponds to a square factor \\(d^2\\) of \\(A\\). So, in the case of \\(n = 2\\), \\(m = 3\\), which has 2 divisors, so the number of square factors is 2, but the number of square rectangles is 1. So, that still doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the number of square rectangles is equal to the number of pairs of integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that \\(a \\times b = A\\) and \\(a = b\\). So, that is, the number of square factors of \\(A\\). So, if \\(A\\) is a square, the number of square factors is equal to the number of square divisors, which is equal to the number of divisors of \\(\\sqrt{A}\\). Since \\(\\sqrt{A} = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\), the number of square factors is equal to the number of divisors of \\(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\).\n\nBut in the case of \\(n = 2\\), \\(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 3\\), which has 2 divisors, so the number of square factors is 2, but the number of square rectangles is 1. So, that suggests that my reasoning is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of square rectangles is equal to the number of square factors, but in the"
