    "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to find the conjugate of a function g(x), which is defined as f(x) plus a linear term plus a constant. Specifically, g(x) = f(x) + c^T x + d, where f is a convex function. I need to express g* in terms of f* and the constants c and d. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the conjugate of a function, denoted as g*, is defined as g*(y) = sup{<x, y> - g(x) | x \u2208 dom g}. So, I need to compute this supremum for the function g(x). Since g(x) is f(x) plus a linear term plus a constant, maybe I can break this down into parts.\n\nLet me write down the definition again:\n\ng*(y) = sup{<x, y> - g(x)} = sup{<x, y> - [f(x) + c^T x + d]}.\n\nI can separate the terms inside the supremum:\n\n= sup{<x, y> - f(x) - c^T x - d}.\n\nHmm, so that's the same as:\n\n= sup{<x, y> - f(x) - c^T x} - d.\n\nWait, because the d is just a constant, so it can be pulled out of the supremum. So, g*(y) = sup{<x, y> - f(x) - c^T x} - d.\n\nNow, I know that the conjugate of f(x) is f*(y) = sup{<x, y> - f(x)}. So, if I can express the remaining part as the conjugate of another function, maybe I can relate it to f*.\n\nLooking at the expression inside the supremum now, it's <x, y> - f(x) - c^T x. Let me factor out the x terms:\n\n= sup{<x, y - c> - f(x)}.\n\nBecause c^T x is the same as <c, x>, so combining them gives <x, y - c>. So, now the expression becomes:\n\ng*(y) = sup{<x, y - c> - f(x)} - d.\n\nBut the supremum of <x, y - c> - f(x) is exactly the definition of the conjugate of f at (y - c), right? So, that's f*(y - c). Therefore, putting it all together:\n\ng*(y) = f*(y - c) - d.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, if I have g(x) = f(x) + c^T x + d, then the conjugate g*(y) is the conjugate of f(x) plus the conjugate of c^T x plus the conjugate of d. But wait, the conjugate of a constant is zero, right? Because the conjugate of a constant function is zero. So, actually, the conjugate of c^T x is c* x, but wait, no, that's not quite right.\n\nWait, no, the conjugate of a linear function. Let me recall: the conjugate of a linear function a^T x + b is a* x - b, but since a linear function is its own conjugate up to a sign. Wait, actually, the conjugate of a linear function a^T x + b is a* x - b, but if a is a vector, then a* is a scalar equal to a^T. So, if I have a linear function a^T x + b, its conjugate is a^T x - b. But in our case, the linear term is c^T x, so the conjugate of that term is c^T x - d? Wait, no, hold on.\n\nWait, no, the conjugate of c^T x is c^T x, because the conjugate of a linear function a^T x is a^T x. But in our case, the linear term is c^T x, so the conjugate of c^T x is c^T x. But wait, that can't be right because the conjugate of a linear function is itself, but with a negative sign? Wait, no, let me recall the definition.\n\nThe conjugate function is g*(y) = sup{<x, y> - g(x)}. So, for g(x) = c^T x + d, the conjugate would be sup{<x, y> - c^T x - d} = sup{<x, y - c> - d}. So, that's equal to d - d = 0? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, let's compute it step by step.\n\nCompute g*(y) = sup{<x, y> - (c^T x + d)} = sup{<x, y - c> - d}.\n\nBut the supremum of <x, y - c> - d is equal to infinity unless y - c is in the domain of f*, but since f is convex, f* is convex and lower semi-continuous, so the supremum is infinity unless y - c is in the domain of f*. Wait, but in our case, we have g*(y) = sup{<x, y - c> - d}.\n\nWait, but if we factor out the d, it's equal to sup{<x, y - c> - d} = sup{<x, y - c>} - d. But the supremum of <x, y - c> is infinity unless y - c is in the domain of f*, but since f is convex, f* is defined on all of R^n, so the supremum is infinity. But that can't be right because g*(y) should be finite.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in separating the terms. Let me go back.\n\ng(x) = f(x) + c^T x + d.\n\nSo, g*(y) = sup{<x, y> - f(x) - c^T x - d}.\n\nWe can rearrange the terms:\n\n= sup{<x, y - c> - f(x) - d}.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me see:\n\n< x, y > - f(x) - c^T x - d = <x, y - c> - f(x) - d.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because <x, y> - c^T x = <x, y - c>, right? So, that part is correct.\n\nSo, g*(y) = sup{<x, y - c> - f(x) - d}.\n\nBut the supremum of <x, y - c> - f(x) is f*(y - c), and then we have -d. So, g*(y) = f*(y - c) - d.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the conjugate of a linear function is itself, but in this case, we have a constant term subtracted. So, is it just f*(y - c) - d?\n\nWait, let me test this with a simple example. Let f(x) = 0, which is a constant function, so it's convex. Then, g(x) = 0 + c^T x + d. So, g*(y) should be the conjugate of c^T x + d.\n\nCompute g*(y) = sup{<x, y> - c^T x - d} = sup{<x, y - c> - d}.\n\nThe supremum of <x, y - c> - d is infinity unless y - c is in the domain of f*, but since f is constant zero, f*(y) = 0 for all y. So, sup{<x, y - c> - d} = sup{<x, y - c>} - d. But the supremum of <x, y - c> is infinity unless y - c is in the domain of f*, which it is for all y. So, the supremum is infinity, so g*(y) = infinity - d, which is infinity. But that can't be right because g(x) = c^T x + d is a linear function, so its conjugate should be a linear function as well.\n\nWait, no, actually, the conjugate of a linear function is a linear function only if it's proper and convex. Wait, no, the conjugate of a linear function is a linear function only if it's proper and convex, but in this case, c^T x + d is affine, not convex. Wait, affine functions are convex and concave, but their conjugates are not necessarily affine.\n\nWait, let me recall: the conjugate of a linear function a^T x + b is a^T x - b. So, if we have g(x) = c^T x + d, then g*(y) = c^T y - d. Wait, that makes sense because:\n\ng*(y) = sup{<x, y> - (c^T x + d)} = sup{<x, y - c> - d}.\n\nBut the supremum of <x, y - c> - d is infinity unless y - c is in the domain of f*, but since f is constant zero, f*(y) = 0 for all y. So, the supremum is infinity, so g*(y) = infinity - d, which is infinity. But that contradicts the idea that the"
