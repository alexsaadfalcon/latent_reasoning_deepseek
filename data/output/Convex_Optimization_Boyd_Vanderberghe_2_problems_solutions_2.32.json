Think briefly and provide a simple answer in the form of a statement or equation.\nFind the dual cone of {Ax | x \u227d 0}, where A \u2208 R^m\u00d7n.\n<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c>\n<think>\n<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I need to find the dual cone of {Ax | x \u227d 0}, where A is an m\u00d7n matrix. Hmm, let me start by recalling what a dual cone is. From what I remember, the dual cone of a given cone C is the set of all vectors y such that y is non-negative with respect to every vector in C. In other words, for every x in C, y^T x is greater than or equal to zero. \n\nSo, in this case, the cone C is {Ax | x \u227d 0}. That means C consists of all vectors that can be obtained by multiplying A with a non-negative vector x. Now, to find the dual cone of C, I need to find all vectors y such that y^T x \u2265 0 for every x in C. \n\nLet me write that down: y \u2208 C^* if and only if y^T x \u2265 0 for all x \u227d 0. But since x is in C, which is {Ax | x \u227d 0}, I can substitute x with Ax. So, y^T Ax \u2265 0 for all x \u227d 0. \n\nWait, that seems a bit abstract. Maybe I can think about it differently. If I let z = x, then the condition becomes y^T A z \u2265 0 for all z \u227d 0. But z is any non-negative vector, so this is equivalent to saying that y^T A is a non-negative vector for all z \u227d 0. \n\nHmm, but how does that translate into a condition on y? I think I need to consider the transpose of A. Let me denote A^T as the transpose of A. Then, the condition y^T A z \u2265 0 for all z \u227d 0 can be rewritten as (A^T y)^T z \u2265 0 for all z \u227d 0. \n\nSince z is any non-negative vector, the only way (A^T y)^T z can be non-negative for all z is if A^T y is a non-negative vector. Because if A^T y had any negative component, then choosing z to have a positive component in that direction would make the inner product negative, which would violate the condition. \n\nTherefore, A^T y must be a non-negative vector. So, y must satisfy A^T y \u227d 0. \n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. If A^T y is non-negative, then for any z \u227d 0, (A^T y)^T z = y^T A z \u2265 0, which is exactly the condition we needed. So, yes, that seems correct. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the dual cone of {Ax | x \u227d 0} is the set of all vectors y such that A^T y is non-negative. In mathematical terms, that's {y | A^T y \u227d 0}. \n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just recap: the dual cone is defined by the condition that the inner product with any element of the original cone is non-negative. By substituting x with Ax and using the transpose of A, we find that A^T y must be non-negative. So, the dual cone is the set of all y where A^T y is in the non-negative orthant. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. It all flows logically from the definition of the dual cone and the substitution of variables. So, the dual cone should indeed be {y | A^T y \u227d 0}.\n</think>\n\nThe dual cone of {Ax | x \u227d 0} is the set of all vectors y such that A^T y is non-negative. Therefore, the dual cone is {y | A^T y \u227d 0}.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Original Cone:** The cone C is defined as {Ax | x \u227d 0}, which consists of all vectors obtained by multiplying matrix A with a non-negative vector x.\n\n2. **Definition of Dual Cone:** The dual cone C^* is the set of all vectors y such that y^T x \u2265 0 for every x in C.\n\n3. **Substitute x in the Condition:** Since x is in C, we substitute x with Ax, leading to y^T Ax \u2265 0 for all x \u227d 0.\n\n4. **Transpose Matrix A:** To simplify, consider the transpose of A, denoted as A^T. The condition becomes (A^T y)^T z \u2265 0 for all z \u227d 0, where z = x.\n\n5. **Non-Negative Vector Requirement:** For the inequality to hold for all z \u227d 0, A^T y must be a non-negative vector. This ensures that the inner product with any non-negative z is non-negative.\n\n6. **Final Dual Cone:** Therefore, the dual cone C^* is the set of all y where A^T y is non-negative, expressed as {y | A^T y \u227d 0}.\n\n**Answer:** The dual cone of {Ax | x \u227d 0} is {y | A^T y \u227d 0}."
