Think briefly and provide a simple answer in the form of a statement or equation.\nWhich of the following sets are convex? A rectangle, i.e., a set of the form {x \u2208 R^n| \u03b1_i \u2264 x_i \u2264 \u03b2_i, i = 1,...,n}. A rectangle is sometimes called a hyperrectangle when n > 2.\n<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c>\n<think>\n<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nTo determine if a set is convex, I need to check if the line segment between any two points within the set lies entirely within the set.\n\nFor a rectangle defined by {x \u2208 R^n | \u03b1_i \u2264 x_i \u2264 \u03b2_i, i = 1, ..., n}, any two points inside the rectangle will have their coordinates bounded between the minimum and maximum values of \u03b1_i and \u03b2_i. Therefore, the line segment connecting these two points will also satisfy the inequalities \u03b1_i \u2264 x_i \u2264 \u03b2_i for all i, ensuring that the entire segment remains within the rectangle.\n\nThus, a rectangle is a convex set.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nA set \\( S \\) in \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\) is **convex** if, for any two points \\( \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y} \\in S \\), the line segment connecting \\( \\mathbf{x} \\) and \\( \\mathbf{y} \\) is entirely contained within \\( S \\). Mathematically, this means:\n\\[\n\\forall \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y} \\in S,\\ \\forall t \\in [0, 1],\\ (1 - t)\\mathbf{x} + t\\mathbf{y} \\in S\n\\]\n\nFor a rectangle defined by:\n\\[\nS = \\left\\{ \\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\,\\big|\\, \\alpha_i \\leq x_i \\leq \\beta_i,\\ i = 1, \\ldots, n \\right\\}\n\\]\nwhere \\( \\alpha_i \\) and \\( \\beta_i \\) are the minimum and maximum bounds for each coordinate \\( x_i \\) respectively.\n\n**Verification:**\n\n1. **Take any two points** \\( \\mathbf{x} \\) and \\( \\mathbf{y} \\) in \\( S \\). This means:\n   \\[\n   \\alpha_i \\leq x_i \\leq \\beta_i \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\alpha_i \\leq y_i \\leq \\beta_i \\quad \\forall i\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the line segment** between \\( \\mathbf{x} \\) and \\( \\mathbf{y} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{z}(t) = (1 - t)\\mathbf{x} + t\\mathbf{y}, \\quad t \\in [0, 1]\n   \\]\n   For each coordinate \\( z_i(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   \\alpha_i \\leq z_i(t) \\leq \\beta_i\n   \\]\n   This is because the bounds are preserved under linear combinations with coefficients between 0 and 1.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** Since the line segment between any two points in \\( S \\) lies entirely within \\( S \\), the set \\( S \\) is **convex**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{A rectangle is a convex set.}}\n\\]"
