    "problem": "Derive the conjugates of the following functions. Geometric mean. f(x) = -(\u220f x_i)^{1/n} on R^n_++.",
    "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the conjugate of the function f(x) = - (product of x_i)^{1/n} on R^n_+. Hmm, conjugate functions... I remember that the conjugate function, denoted as f*(y), is defined as the supremum of the linear functional y\u00b7x - f(x) over all x in the domain. So, in this case, f(x) is defined on R^n_+, which is the positive orthant, meaning all x_i are positive real numbers.\n\nFirst, let me write down the function clearly: f(x) = - (x_1 x_2 ... x_n)^{1/n}. So, it's the negative of the geometric mean of the x_i's. I need to find f*(y) = sup{ y\u00b7x - f(x) | x \u2208 R^n_+ }.\n\nSince f(x) is defined on R^n_+, x_i must be positive. So, when taking the supremum, I have to consider x_i > 0.\n\nI think I should use the definition of the conjugate function and try to maximize y\u00b7x - f(x). Let's write that out:\n\nf*(y) = sup{ y_1 x_1 + y_2 x_2 + ... + y_n x_n - (x_1 x_2 ... x_n)^{1/n} | x_i > 0 }\n\nThis looks like a maximization problem with multiple variables. Maybe I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers here. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a substitution or apply some inequality.\n\nWait, the function inside the supremum is y\u00b7x - (product x_i)^{1/n}. Since we're dealing with positive x_i, maybe I can take logarithms to simplify the product. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote t_i = ln x_i, so x_i = e^{t_i}. Then, the product x_1 x_2 ... x_n = e^{t_1 + t_2 + ... + t_n} = e^{t}. So, (product x_i)^{1/n} = e^{t/n}.\n\nSo, substituting back into f(x), we have f(x) = - e^{t/n} = - e^{(1/n) sum t_i}.\n\nNow, the linear term y\u00b7x becomes y_1 e^{t_1} + y_2 e^{t_2} + ... + y_n e^{t_n}.\n\nSo, the expression inside the supremum becomes:\n\nsum_{i=1}^n y_i e^{t_i} - e^{(1/n) sum t_i}\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can consider taking the logarithm again or see if there's a substitution that can make this easier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the AM-GM inequality. Wait, the function f(x) is related to the geometric mean, and the conjugate function is often connected to convex functions.\n\nWait, f(x) is actually a concave function because the geometric mean is concave, and the negative of a concave function is convex? Wait, no, actually, the geometric mean is concave, so negative of it would be convex. So, f(x) is convex.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me recall: The geometric mean is concave, so -GM is convex. So, f(x) is convex. Therefore, its conjugate should be convex as well.\n\nBut I need to compute the conjugate. Let me think about the structure of f(x). It's a product of x_i's raised to the 1/n power. So, it's a multiplicative function, and its conjugate would involve some kind of logarithmic or exponential terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the concept of duality in convex conjugates. For a function f, the conjugate f*(y) is the maximum of y\u00b7x - f(x). So, perhaps I can write this as:\n\nf*(y) = sup_{x > 0} [ y\u00b7x - (product x_i)^{1/n} ]\n\nLet me consider taking the logarithm of x_i to make the product into a sum. Let me set t_i = ln x_i, so x_i = e^{t_i}, and t_i \u2208 R.\n\nThen, the function becomes:\n\nf(x) = - (e^{t_1} e^{t_2} ... e^{t_n})^{1/n} = - e^{(t_1 + t_2 + ... + t_n)/n} = - e^{(1/n) sum t_i}\n\nSo, f(x) = - e^{(1/n) sum t_i}\n\nThen, the linear term y\u00b7x is y_1 e^{t_1} + y_2 e^{t_2} + ... + y_n e^{t_n}\n\nSo, the expression inside the supremum is:\n\nsum_{i=1}^n y_i e^{t_i} - e^{(1/n) sum t_i}\n\nHmm, this is still a bit tricky. Maybe I can consider taking the derivative with respect to each t_i and set it to zero to find the maximum.\n\nLet me denote S = sum_{i=1}^n t_i, so f(x) = - e^{S/n}, and the linear term is sum y_i e^{t_i}.\n\nSo, the expression to maximize is:\n\nsum y_i e^{t_i} - e^{S/n}\n\nLet me compute the derivative with respect to t_j:\n\nd/dt_j [sum y_i e^{t_i} - e^{S/n}] = y_j e^{t_j} - (1/n) e^{S/n}\n\nSet this equal to zero for each j:\n\ny_j e^{t_j} - (1/n) e^{S/n} = 0\n\nSo, y_j e^{t_j} = (1/n) e^{S/n}\n\nLet me solve for e^{t_j}:\n\ne^{t_j} = (1/(n y_j)) e^{S/n}\n\nBut S = sum_{i=1}^n t_i, so e^{S/n} = e^{(1/n) sum t_i} = product_{i=1}^n e^{t_i/n} = product_{i=1}^n (1/(n y_i))^{1/n}\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nFrom e^{t_j} = (1/(n y_j)) e^{S/n}, and S = sum t_i, so e^{S/n} = e^{(1/n) sum t_i}.\n\nBut from the equation, e^{t_j} = (1/(n y_j)) e^{S/n}, so if I take the product over all j:\n\nproduct_{j=1}^n e^{t_j} = product_{j=1}^n (1/(n y_j)) e^{S/n}\n\nLeft side: product e^{t_j} = e^{S}\n\nRight side: product (1/(n y_j)) e^{S/n} = (1/(n^n)) product (1/y_j) e^{S/n}\n\nSo, e^{S} = (1/(n^n)) product (1/y_j) e^{S/n}\n\nMultiply both sides by n^n:\n\nn^n e^{S} = product (1/y_j) e^{S/n}\n\nDivide both sides by e^{S/n}:\n\nn^n e^{S - S/n} = product (1/y_j)\n\nSimplify exponent:\n\nS - S/n = S(1 - 1/n) = S(n-1)/n\n\nSo, n^n e^{S(n-1)/n} = product (1/y_j)\n\nTake natural logarithm on both sides:\n\nln(n^n) + (n-1)/n S = - sum_{j=1}^n ln y_j\n\nSimplify:\n\nn ln n + (n-1)/n S = - sum ln y_j\n\nBut S = sum t_j, and from earlier, e^{t_j} = (1/(n y_j)) e^{S/n}\n\nSo, e^{t_j} = (1/(n y_j)) e^{S/n}\n\nMultiply both sides by n y_j:\n\nn y_j e^{t_j} = e^{S/n}\n\nTake natural log:\n\nln(n y_j) + t_j = (S)/n\n\nSo, t_j = (S)/n - ln(n y_j)\n\nBut S = sum t_j, so:\n\nS = sum [ (S)/n - ln(n y_j) ] = (n S)/n - sum ln(n y_j) = S - sum ln(n y_j)\n\nSo, S = S - sum ln(n y_j)\n\nSubtract S from both sides:\n\n0 = - sum ln(n y_j)\n\nSo, sum ln(n y_j) = 0\n\nWhich implies ln( product (n y_j) ) = 0\n\nTherefore, product (n y_j) = e^0 = 1\n\nSo, product y_j = 1/n^n\n\nSo, we have that the maximum occurs when product y_j = 1/n^n.\n\nBut wait, let me recap. We found that at the maximum, product y_j = 1/n^n, and also, from earlier, e^{t_j} = (1/(n y_j)) e^{S/n}\n\nBut since S = sum t_j, and t_j = (S)/n - ln(n y_j), substituting back:\n\nt_j = (S)/n - ln(n y_j)\n\nBut S = sum t_j, so:\n\nS = sum [ (S)/n - ln"
