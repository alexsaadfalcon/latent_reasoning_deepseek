Think briefly and provide a simple answer in the form of a statement or equation.\nLet C = {x \u2208 R^n | ||x||_\u221e \u2264 1}, the l_\u221e-norm unit ball in R^n, and let x^ be a point in the boundary of C. Identify the supporting hyperplanes of C at x^ explicitly.\n<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c>\n<think>\n<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I need to find the supporting hyperplanes of the unit ball C at a point x^ on its boundary. Let me start by recalling what the l_infinity norm is. The l_infinity norm of a vector x in R^n is defined as the maximum absolute value among its components. So, ||x||_\u221e \u2264 1 means that each component of x is between -1 and 1, right? So, the unit ball C is all the points where the maximum of |x1|, |x2|, ..., |xn| is less than or equal to 1.\n\nNow, a supporting hyperplane at a point x^ on the boundary of C should touch the ball exactly at x^ and lie entirely on one side of the ball. Since x^ is on the boundary, ||x^||_\u221e = 1. The supporting hyperplane should be such that for any point y in C, the inner product of y with the normal vector of the hyperplane is less than or equal to the inner product of x^ with the normal vector.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the definition of a supporting hyperplane. It's a hyperplane that touches the convex set at a point and lies entirely within the set. For the unit ball, which is a convex set, the supporting hyperplane at x^ should satisfy that for all y in C, (y - x^) \u00b7 n \u2264 0, where n is the normal vector to the hyperplane.\n\nBut I'm not sure if I'm mixing up the definitions. Let me think again. The supporting hyperplane at x^ should satisfy that for all y in C, (y - x^) \u00b7 n \u2264 0, where n is the normal vector. Alternatively, it can be written as n \u00b7 y \u2264 n \u00b7 x^.\n\nSince x^ is on the boundary, ||x^||_\u221e = 1. So, each component of x^ is either 1 or -1, but since it's on the boundary, at least one component is exactly 1 or -1. Wait, no, actually, the boundary includes all points where at least one component is exactly 1 or -1, but the others are within [-1,1]. Hmm, no, actually, for the l_infinity norm, the boundary is the set of points where at least one component is exactly 1 or -1, and the others are within [-1,1]. Wait, no, that's not quite right. The l_infinity norm is the maximum of the absolute values, so the boundary is the set of points where the maximum is exactly 1. So, that would include points where one component is 1 and the others are between -1 and 1, or points where one component is -1 and the others are between -1 and 1, or points where multiple components are 1 or -1.\n\nWait, no, actually, the l_infinity unit ball is the set of all points where each component is between -1 and 1, and the maximum absolute value is less than or equal to 1. So, the boundary is where the maximum is exactly 1. So, any point on the boundary has at least one component equal to 1 or -1, and the others are within [-1,1]. So, for example, points like (1, 0, 0, ..., 0), (-1, 0, ..., 0), (0, 1, 0, ..., 0), etc., are on the boundary.\n\nNow, to find the supporting hyperplane at such a point, say x^ = (1, 0, ..., 0). The supporting hyperplane should be such that it touches x^ and lies entirely within C. Since the l_infinity norm is the maximum of the absolute values, the supporting hyperplane at (1, 0, ..., 0) should be the hyperplane where the first component is equal to 1. Because any point in C has the first component \u2264 1, so the hyperplane x1 = 1 is a supporting hyperplane at (1, 0, ..., 0).\n\nSimilarly, for the point (-1, 0, ..., 0), the supporting hyperplane would be x1 = -1.\n\nFor a point like (0, 1, 0, ..., 0), the supporting hyperplane would be y1 = 1, because any point in C has y1 \u2264 1, so the hyperplane y1 = 1 is a supporting hyperplane at (0, 1, 0, ..., 0).\n\nWait, but I think I might be missing something. The supporting hyperplane should be such that it's tangent to the ball at x^ and lies entirely within the ball. So, for x^ = (1, 0, ..., 0), the hyperplane x1 = 1 is indeed a supporting hyperplane because it touches x^ and all other points in C have x1 \u2264 1, so they lie on one side of the hyperplane.\n\nSimilarly, for x^ = (0, 1, 0, ..., 0), the hyperplane y1 = 1 is a supporting hyperplane because all points in C have y1 \u2264 1, so they lie on or below this hyperplane.\n\nWait, but I think I should consider all possible points on the boundary. For example, a point like (1/2, 1/2, 0, ..., 0) is on the boundary because the maximum of |1/2|, |1/2|, 0, ..., 0 is 1/2, which is less than 1. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, the l_infinity norm is the maximum of the absolute values, so if a point has components like (1, 1, 0, ..., 0), then the l_infinity norm is 1, so it's on the boundary. So, for such a point, the supporting hyperplanes would be x1 = 1 and x2 = 1, because those are the hyperplanes that touch the point and lie within the ball.\n\nWait, but actually, for a point like (1, 1, 0, ..., 0), the maximum is 1, so the hyperplanes x1 = 1 and x2 = 1 would both be supporting hyperplanes at that point. So, the supporting hyperplanes at any point on the boundary would be the hyperplanes where each component that is non-zero at x^ is set to 1.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because for a point like (1, 1, 0, ..., 0), the hyperplanes x1 = 1 and x2 = 1 would both be supporting hyperplanes, but perhaps the correct approach is to consider that for each coordinate where the point has a non-zero component, the corresponding hyperplane is a supporting hyperplane.\n\nWait, but actually, the supporting hyperplane at x^ is determined by the gradient of the function defining the boundary. The l_infinity norm is not differentiable at points where multiple components are non-zero, but at points where only one component is non-zero, the gradient is a standard basis vector. So, for example, at (1, 0, ..., 0), the gradient is (1, 0, ..., 0), so the supporting hyperplane is x1 = 1. Similarly, at (0, 1, 0, ..., 0), the gradient is (0, 1, 0, ..., 0), so the supporting hyperplane is y1 = 1.\n\nBut wait, for a point like (1, 1, 0, ..., 0), the gradient is not a single standard basis vector because the function is not differentiable there. Instead, the supporting hyperplanes would be the hyperplanes where each non-zero component is set to 1. So, for (1, 1, 0, ..., 0), the supporting hyperplanes would be x1 = 1 and x2 = 1.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. The supporting hyperplane at a point x^ on the boundary of C is the set of points y such that y \u00b7 n \u2264 y^ \u00b7 n, where n is the normal vector. For the l_infinity unit ball, the normal vector at x^ would be the gradient of the function defining the boundary at that point. But since the l_infinity norm is not differentiable at points where multiple components are non-zero, the gradient is not defined there. However, we can still define the supporting hyperplane using the subgradient.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to realize that for the l_infinity unit ball, the supporting hyperplanes at points on the boundary are the hyperplanes where each component that is non-zero at x^ is set to 1. So, for example, at (1, 0, ..., 0), the hyperplane x1 = 1 is a supporting hyperplane. Similarly, at (0, 1, 0, ..., 0), the hyperplane y1 = 1 is a supporting hyperplane. At (1, 1, 0, ..., 0), the hyperplanes x1 = 1 and x2 = 1 are supporting hyperplanes.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to formalize this. The supporting hyperplane at x^ is the set of points y such that y \u00b7 n \u2264 y^ \u00b7 n, where n is a normal vector to the hyperplane. For the l_infinity unit ball, the normal vector at x^ is the vector where each component is the sign of x_i, but since x^ is on the boundary, at least one"
