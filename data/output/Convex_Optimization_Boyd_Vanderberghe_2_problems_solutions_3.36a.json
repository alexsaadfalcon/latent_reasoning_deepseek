    "problem": "Derive the conjugates of the following functions. Max function. f(x) = max_{i=1,...,n} x_i on R^n.",
    "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the conjugate of the function f(x) = max_{i=1,...,n} x_i on R^n. Hmm, I remember that the conjugate function, also known as the Fenchel conjugate, is defined as f*(y) = sup{<x, y> - f(x) | x \u2208 R^n}. So, in this case, f(x) is the maximum of several linear functions x_i. \n\nLet me write that down: f(x) = max_{i=1}^n x_i. So, the conjugate f*(y) would be the supremum over all x of <x, y> - max_{i=1}^n x_i. \n\nWait, maybe I can rewrite this. Since max x_i is the maximum of the individual x_i's, perhaps I can consider each x_i separately. Let me think about how the conjugate behaves with maxima.\n\nI recall that for functions of the form f(x) = max g_i(x), the conjugate f*(y) is the infimum of the conjugates of each g_i. Is that right? Let me check. If f(x) = max g_i(x), then f*(y) = inf_{i} g_i*(y). Yeah, that seems familiar. So, in this case, each g_i(x) is just x_i, so g_i*(y) would be the conjugate of x_i, which is... Hmm, what's the conjugate of x_i?\n\nWait, the conjugate of a linear function. The conjugate of a linear function a*x is (a^2)/2, right? Because the conjugate function is defined as f*(y) = sup{<x, y> - f(x)}. So, if f(x) = x_i, then f*(y) = sup{<x, y> - x_i} = sup{y_i x_i - x_i} = sup{(y_i - 1)x_i}. \n\nBut wait, if y_i - 1 is positive, then as x_i goes to infinity, the expression goes to infinity, so the supremum is infinity. If y_i - 1 is negative, then as x_i goes to negative infinity, the expression goes to infinity, so again the supremum is infinity. If y_i - 1 is zero, then the expression is zero. So, the supremum is zero. Therefore, the conjugate of x_i is (y_i)^2 / 2. Wait, no, hold on. Let me recast that.\n\nWait, if f(x) = x_i, then f*(y) = sup{<x, y> - x_i} = sup{y_i x_i - x_i} = sup{(y_i - 1)x_i}. So, if y_i - 1 > 0, then as x_i approaches infinity, the expression goes to infinity. If y_i - 1 < 0, then as x_i approaches negative infinity, the expression goes to infinity. If y_i - 1 = 0, then the expression is zero. So, the supremum is zero. Therefore, the conjugate of x_i is zero? That can't be right because the conjugate of a linear function should be a quadratic function.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. The conjugate of f(x) = x_i is f*(y) = sup{y_i x_i - x_i} = sup{(y_i - 1)x_i}. So, if y_i - 1 > 0, then as x_i increases, the expression goes to infinity. If y_i - 1 < 0, as x_i decreases, the expression goes to infinity. If y_i - 1 = 0, then the expression is zero. So, the supremum is infinity unless y_i - 1 = 0, in which case it's zero. So, f*(y) = 0 if y_i = 1 for all i, and infinity otherwise. That seems odd.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the conjugate function should be convex and lower semi-continuous. If f*(y) is zero only at y_i = 1 for all i, that would make it a single point, which is not convex. So, I must have messed up somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that f(x) = max x_i is actually a convex function, and its conjugate should be another convex function. But if each x_i is linear, then the conjugate of each x_i is (y_i)^2 / 2, right? Because for f(x) = x_i, the conjugate is f*(y) = sup{y_i x_i - x_i} = sup{(y_i - 1)x_i}. If y_i - 1 > 0, then as x_i approaches infinity, the expression goes to infinity. If y_i - 1 < 0, as x_i approaches negative infinity, the expression goes to infinity. If y_i - 1 = 0, then the expression is zero. So, the supremum is infinity unless y_i = 1, in which case it's zero. So, f*(y) = 0 if y_i = 1 for all i, else infinity. That seems correct.\n\nBut then, if f(x) = max x_i, then f*(y) is zero only when y_i = 1 for all i, else infinity. So, f*(y) is zero at y = (1,1,...,1) and infinity elsewhere. That seems like a convex function, but it's not differentiable. Hmm.\n\nWait, but maybe I can think of f(x) as a piecewise linear function. The maximum of x_i is a convex function, and its subdifferential is the set of points where the maximum switches from one x_i to another. So, the subdifferential of f at a point x is the set of indices i where x_i = max x_j. So, for example, if x is such that x_i is the maximum, then the subdifferential at x is {i}.\n\nBut the conjugate function f*(y) is related to the support function of the subdifferential. The support function is defined as h_D(y) = sup{<x, y> | x \u2208 D}. So, in this case, f*(y) is the support function of the subdifferential of f. So, if the subdifferential of f is {i} when x_i is the maximum, then f*(y) is the maximum over i of <x, y> where x_i is the maximum.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit circular. Maybe I need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that f(x) = max x_i is a convex function, and its conjugate can be found by considering the dual problem. The conjugate is the supremum over x of <x, y> - max x_i. So, f*(y) = sup_x [ <x, y> - max x_i ].\n\nLet me try to write this as sup_x [ <x, y> - max x_i ] = sup_x [ <x, y> - x_k ] where k is the index where x_k is the maximum. So, for each k, we can consider the supremum over x of [ <x, y> - x_k ].\n\nSo, for each k, the expression is <x, y> - x_k. Let's write this as (y_1 x_1 + ... + y_n x_n) - x_k. So, for each k, we can think of this as a linear function in x. The supremum over x of this expression would be infinity unless the coefficient of x_k is non-positive. Because if the coefficient of x_k is positive, then as x_k increases, the expression goes to infinity. If it's negative, as x_k decreases, the expression goes to infinity. If it's zero, then the expression is bounded.\n\nWait, so for each k, the coefficient of x_k in the expression <x, y> - x_k is y_k - 1. So, if y_k - 1 > 0, then the expression can be made arbitrarily large by increasing x_k, so the supremum is infinity. If y_k - 1 < 0, then the expression can be made arbitrarily large by decreasing x_k, so the supremum is infinity. If y_k - 1 = 0, then the expression is zero, so the supremum is zero.\n\nTherefore, for each k, the supremum over x of [ <x, y> - x_k ] is zero if y_k = 1, and infinity otherwise. So, f*(y) is the maximum over k of these suprema, which is zero if y_k = 1 for all k, and infinity otherwise. So, f*(y) is zero at y = (1,1,...,1) and infinity elsewhere.\n\nWait, that seems consistent with what I thought earlier. So, f*(y) is zero at y = (1,1,...,1) and infinity otherwise. So, in other words, f*(y) is the indicator function of the point y = (1,1,...,1). That is, f*(y) = 0 if y = (1,1,...,1), else infinity.\n\nBut is that correct? Let me test with a simple case. Let's take n=1. Then f(x) = max x_1 = x. So, f*(y) = sup_x (y x - x) = sup_x x(y - 1). If"
