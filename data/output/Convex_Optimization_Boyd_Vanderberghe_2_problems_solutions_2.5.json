The hyperplanes are defined by the equations a^T x = b\u2081 and a^T x = b\u2082. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that a hyperplane in R^n is a subspace of dimension n-1, which means it's like a flat surface in higher dimensions. The equation a^T x = b represents a hyperplane where a is a normal vector to the hyperplane. So, both hyperplanes have the same normal vector a, which makes sense since they are parallel.\n\nNow, the distance between two parallel hyperplanes should be the same everywhere on the hyperplane, right? So, I need a way to measure how far apart these two hyperplanes are. I think this distance is related to the normal vector a. Maybe it has something to do with the difference in the constants b\u2081 and b\u2082.\n\nLet me recall the formula for the distance from a point to a hyperplane. If I have a point x\u2080 and a hyperplane defined by a^T x = b, the distance from x\u2080 to the hyperplane is |a^T x\u2080 - b| divided by the norm of a. That formula makes sense because it's the absolute value of the dot product of the normal vector with the point minus the constant term, all divided by the length of the normal vector.\n\nSince both hyperplanes are parallel, their normal vectors are the same, so the distance between them should be the same as the distance from any point on one hyperplane to the other hyperplane. Let's pick a point on the first hyperplane, say x\u2081, which satisfies a^T x\u2081 = b\u2081. Then, the distance from x\u2081 to the second hyperplane a^T x = b\u2082 should be |a^T x\u2081 - b\u2082| / ||a||.\n\nSubstituting x\u2081 into the equation, we get |b\u2081 - b\u2082| / ||a||. That seems straightforward. So, the distance between the two hyperplanes is the absolute difference of b\u2081 and b\u2082 divided by the norm of the normal vector a.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Since the hyperplanes are parallel, they don't intersect, so the distance is well-defined. Also, the formula uses the norm of a, which is always positive, so the distance is a positive value regardless of the direction of a.\n\nI think that's it. The distance is |b\u2081 - b\u2082| divided by the norm of a. So, the formula is ||b\u2081 - b\u2082|| / ||a||, but since b\u2081 and b\u2082 are scalars, the absolute value is just |b\u2081 - b\u2082|.\n\nLet me write that down to make sure. The distance D between the two hyperplanes is D = |b\u2081 - b\u2082| / ||a||. That seems correct because it's the magnitude of the difference in the constants divided by the length of the normal vector, which scales the distance appropriately.\n\nI don't think I need to consider any other factors here because the hyperplanes are parallel, so the distance is uniform across the entire hyperplane. There's no need to project or anything else; the formula directly gives the distance.\n\nSo, to summarize, the distance between two parallel hyperplanes is the absolute difference of their constants divided by the norm of the normal vector. That should be the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe distance between two parallel hyperplanes defined by \\( a^T x = b_1 \\) and \\( a^T x = b_2 \\) is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nD = \\frac{|b_1 - b_2|}{\\|a\\|}\n\\]\n\nThis formula calculates the distance by taking the absolute difference of the constants \\( b_1 \\) and \\( b_2 \\), divided by the norm of the normal vector \\( a \\)."
