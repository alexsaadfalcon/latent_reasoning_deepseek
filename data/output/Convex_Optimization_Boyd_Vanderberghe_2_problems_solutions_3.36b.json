    "problem": "Derive the conjugates of the following functions. Sum of largest elements. f(x) = \u2211^r_{i=1} x_{[i]} on R^n.",
    "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to find the conjugate of the function f(x) = \u2211_{i=1}^r x_{[i]} on R^n. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the conjugate function, often denoted as f*(y), is defined as the supremum of the linear functional y\u00b7x minus f(x) over all x in R^n. So, mathematically, that's f*(y) = sup_{x \u2208 R^n} { y\u00b7x - f(x) }.\n\nGiven that f(x) is the sum of the first r components of x, right? So, f(x) = x\u2081 + x\u2082 + ... + x_r. That makes sense because it's a sum of the first r elements of the vector x.\n\nSo, substituting f(x) into the conjugate definition, we get:\n\nf*(y) = sup_{x \u2208 R^n} { y\u00b7x - (x\u2081 + x\u2082 + ... + x_r) }.\n\nLet me write that out more clearly:\n\nf*(y) = sup_{x \u2208 R^n} { y\u2081x\u2081 + y\u2082x\u2082 + ... + y_nx_n - (x\u2081 + x\u2082 + ... + x_r) }.\n\nHmm, okay. So, I can separate this into the sum of each component. Let's see:\n\n= sup_{x \u2208 R^n} { (y\u2081 - 1)x\u2081 + (y\u2082 - 1)x\u2082 + ... + (y_r - 1)x_r + (y_{r+1} + ... + y_n)x_{r+1} + ... + y_nx_n }.\n\nWait, that might not be the best way to separate them. Let me think again. Each term in the sum is y_i x_i minus x_i for i from 1 to r. So, for each i from 1 to r, the coefficient is y_i - 1. For the other components, from r+1 to n, the coefficient is just y_i.\n\nSo, f*(y) = sup_{x \u2208 R^n} { \u03a3_{i=1}^r (y_i - 1)x_i + \u03a3_{i=r+1}^n y_i x_i }.\n\nNow, since we're taking the supremum over all x, each of these sums can be considered separately because they are linear in x. So, for each i from 1 to r, the term is (y_i - 1)x_i, and for i from r+1 to n, it's y_i x_i.\n\nTo maximize each of these, we can consider each term individually. For each i from 1 to r, the expression (y_i - 1)x_i is linear in x_i. The supremum over x_i is either unbounded above or negative infinity, depending on the sign of (y_i - 1).\n\nSimilarly, for each i from r+1 to n, the expression y_i x_i is linear in x_i, and the supremum is again either unbounded above or negative infinity, depending on the sign of y_i.\n\nBut wait, in the conjugate function, we're looking for the supremum over all x. So, if any of the coefficients (y_i - 1) or y_i are positive, we can make the corresponding term as large as we want by increasing x_i, which would make the entire expression go to infinity. Therefore, the supremum would be infinity in that case.\n\nHowever, if all the coefficients are non-positive, then the supremum would be zero because we can't make any term positive without making x_i negative, but since we're taking the supremum, we can set x_i to zero to make the expression zero.\n\nWait, let me think again. For each i from 1 to r, the coefficient is (y_i - 1). So, if (y_i - 1) > 0, then increasing x_i would make the term (y_i - 1)x_i go to infinity, so the supremum would be infinity. Similarly, if (y_i - 1) < 0, then decreasing x_i would make the term go to negative infinity, but since we're taking the supremum, we can set x_i to zero to make the term zero. If (y_i - 1) = 0, then the term is zero regardless of x_i.\n\nSimilarly, for the terms from i = r+1 to n, the coefficient is y_i. So, if y_i > 0, then increasing x_i would make the term go to infinity, so the supremum would be infinity. If y_i < 0, then decreasing x_i would make the term go to negative infinity, but again, since we're taking the supremum, we can set x_i to zero to make the term zero. If y_i = 0, then the term is zero regardless of x_i.\n\nTherefore, for the conjugate function f*(y) to be finite, all the coefficients (y_i - 1) and y_i for i from 1 to r and r+1 to n must be non-positive. That is, for each i from 1 to r, y_i - 1 \u2264 0, which implies y_i \u2264 1, and for each i from r+1 to n, y_i \u2264 0.\n\nSo, if y_i > 1 for any i from 1 to r, or y_i > 0 for any i from r+1 to n, then the supremum is infinity, meaning f*(y) is infinity in those cases.\n\nOn the other hand, if y_i \u2264 1 for all i from 1 to r and y_i \u2264 0 for all i from r+1 to n, then the supremum is zero because we can set all x_i to zero, making the entire expression zero.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me verify that. If y_i \u2264 1 for i from 1 to r, then (y_i - 1) \u2264 0, so the term (y_i - 1)x_i is \u2264 0 for any x_i. Similarly, for i from r+1 to n, if y_i \u2264 0, then y_i x_i \u2264 0 for any x_i. So, the entire expression is \u2264 0 for any x. Therefore, the supremum is zero, achieved when all x_i are zero.\n\nBut if any y_i > 1 for i from 1 to r, then (y_i - 1)x_i can be made arbitrarily large positive by increasing x_i, so the supremum is infinity.\n\nSimilarly, if any y_i > 0 for i from r+1 to n, then y_i x_i can be made arbitrarily large positive by increasing x_i, so the supremum is infinity.\n\nTherefore, the conjugate function f*(y) is zero if and only if y_i \u2264 1 for all i from 1 to r and y_i \u2264 0 for all i from r+1 to n. Otherwise, it's infinity.\n\nWait, but let me think about the case when y_i = 1 for some i from 1 to r. Then, (y_i - 1)x_i = 0 for any x_i, so the term doesn't contribute. Similarly, if y_i = 0 for some i from r+1 to n, then y_i x_i = 0 regardless of x_i. So, in those cases, the supremum is still zero.\n\nTherefore, the conjugate function f*(y) is zero if and only if y_i \u2264 1 for all i from 1 to r and y_i \u2264 0 for all i from r+1 to n. Otherwise, it's infinity.\n\nWait, but let me think about the case when y_i = 1 for some i from 1 to r. Then, (y_i - 1)x_i = 0, so that term doesn't affect the supremum. Similarly, if y_i = 0 for some i from r+1 to n, then y_i x_i = 0, so that term also doesn't affect the supremum. So, in those cases, the supremum is still zero.\n\nTherefore, the conjugate function f*(y) is zero if and only if y_i \u2264 1 for i = 1, ..., r and y_i \u2264 0 for i = r+1, ..., n. Otherwise, it's infinity.\n\nWait, but let me test this with a specific example. Let's say n = 2, r = 1. So, f(x) = x\u2081. Then, the conjugate function f*(y) should be the supremum of y\u2081x\u2081 - x\u2081 over all x\u2081, x\u2082.\n\nSo, f*(y) = sup_{x\u2081, x\u2082} { (y\u2081 - 1)x\u2081 + y\u2082x\u2082 }.\n\nNow, for this to be finite, we need (y\u2081 - 1) \u2264 0 and y\u2082 \u2264 0. So, y\u2081 \u2264 1 and y\u2082 \u2264 0.\n\nIf y\u2081 > 1, then (y\u2081 - 1)x\u2081 can be made arbitrarily large positive by increasing x\u2081, so f*(y) = infinity.\n\nIf y\u2081 \u2264 1 and y\u2082 \u2264 0, then f*(y) = 0, achieved when x\u2081 = x\u2082 = 0.\n\nSimilarly, if y\u2081 \u2264 1 and y\u2082 > 0, then f*(y) = infinity because y\u2082x\u2082 can be made arbitrarily large positive by increasing x\u2082.\n\nIf y\u2081 > 1 and y"
