    "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether the quartile function of a discrete random variable is convex, concave, quasiconvex, or quasiconcave. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a random variable x that takes values a\u2081, a\u2082, ..., a\u2099, where a\u2081 < a\u2082 < ... < a\u2099. The probabilities of these values are given by p\u2081, p\u2082, ..., p\u2099, respectively, and they sum up to 1. The quartile function is defined as quartile(x) = inf{\u03b2 | prob(x \u2264 \u03b2) \u2265 0.25}. So, quartile(x) is the smallest \u03b2 such that the probability of x being less than or equal to \u03b2 is at least 0.25.\n\nI need to analyze this function and determine if it's convex, concave, quasiconvex, or quasiconcave. Hmm, okay. Let me recall what these terms mean.\n\nA function is convex if the line segment between any two points on the function lies above the function. Concave is the opposite, where the line segment lies below the function. Quasiconvex is a function where all sublevel sets are convex, and quasiconcave is where all superlevel sets are convex.\n\nSo, I need to figure out the properties of the quartile function. Let me think about how the quartile function behaves as \u03b2 changes.\n\nFirst, let's consider the definition. For a given \u03b2, prob(x \u2264 \u03b2) is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) evaluated at \u03b2. So, quartile(x) is the smallest \u03b2 such that the CDF at \u03b2 is at least 0.25. In other words, quartile(x) is the 25th percentile of the distribution.\n\nNow, let's think about how quartile(x) changes as \u03b2 increases. As \u03b2 increases, prob(x \u2264 \u03b2) increases as well, because the probability of x being less than or equal to a larger \u03b2 is at least as much as for a smaller \u03b2. So, quartile(x) is a non-decreasing function of \u03b2.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check. If \u03b2 increases, the probability that x \u2264 \u03b2 increases, so the smallest \u03b2 that satisfies prob(x \u2264 \u03b2) \u2265 0.25 must also increase. So, yes, quartile(x) is non-decreasing in \u03b2.\n\nSo, quartile(x) is a non-decreasing function. That might help in determining convexity or concavity.\n\nNow, to determine if it's convex or concave, I need to look at its second derivative. But since it's a function of \u03b2, which is a real number, I need to think about its differentiability. However, quartile(x) is defined as the infimum of \u03b2 such that prob(x \u2264 \u03b2) \u2265 0.25. So, it's a left-continuous, non-decreasing function.\n\nWait, actually, quartile(x) is a step function. Because as \u03b2 increases, quartile(x) can only stay the same or increase. So, it's a step function with jumps at certain points where the CDF crosses 0.25.\n\nTherefore, quartile(x) is a step function, which is both non-decreasing and piecewise constant. So, it's not differentiable everywhere, but it's piecewise constant.\n\nHmm, so how do I determine if a step function is convex or concave? Well, for a function to be convex, the line segment between any two points on the function must lie above the function. Similarly, for concave, it must lie below.\n\nBut since quartile(x) is a step function, let's consider two adjacent steps. Suppose at \u03b2 = \u03b2\u2081, quartile(x) jumps from q\u2081 to q\u2082, where q\u2082 > q\u2081. Then, between \u03b2 = \u03b2\u2081 and \u03b2 = \u03b2\u2082, quartile(x) is constant at q\u2082. So, the function is constant on that interval.\n\nNow, to check convexity, let's take two points \u03b2\u2081 and \u03b2\u2082, where \u03b2\u2081 < \u03b2\u2082. The function at \u03b2\u2081 is q\u2081, and at \u03b2\u2082 is q\u2082. The line segment connecting these two points would be a straight line from (\u03b2\u2081, q\u2081) to (\u03b2\u2082, q\u2082). For the function to be convex, this line must lie above the function between \u03b2\u2081 and \u03b2\u2082. But since the function is constant on that interval, the line will lie above it only if q\u2082 \u2265 (q\u2081 + q\u2082)/(2) * (\u03b2\u2082 - \u03b2\u2081)/(\u03b2\u2082 - \u03b2\u2081) + q\u2081*(\u03b2 - \u03b2\u2081)/(\u03b2\u2082 - \u03b2\u2081). Wait, that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to consider the definition. For convexity, for any \u03b2\u2081, \u03b2\u2082, and \u03bb \u2208 [0,1], quartile(\u03bb\u03b2\u2081 + (1 - \u03bb)\u03b2\u2082) \u2264 \u03bb quartile(\u03b2\u2081) + (1 - \u03bb) quartile(\u03b2\u2082).\n\nBut since quartile(x) is constant on intervals, let's pick two points in the same interval. Suppose \u03b2\u2081 and \u03b2\u2082 are in the same interval where quartile(x) is constant at q. Then, quartile(\u03bb\u03b2\u2081 + (1 - \u03bb)\u03b2\u2082) = q, and \u03bb q + (1 - \u03bb) q = q. So, equality holds, which is fine for convexity.\n\nNow, if \u03b2\u2081 and \u03b2\u2082 are in different intervals, say \u03b2\u2081 is in [\u03b2\u2081, \u03b2\u2082) and \u03b2\u2082 is in [\u03b2\u2082, \u03b2\u2083). Then, quartile(\u03b2\u2081) = q\u2081 and quartile(\u03b2\u2082) = q\u2082. The line segment between (\u03b2\u2081, q\u2081) and (\u03b2\u2082, q\u2082) is a straight line. For the function to be convex, quartile(\u03bb\u03b2\u2081 + (1 - \u03bb)\u03b2\u2082) must be \u2264 \u03bb q\u2081 + (1 - \u03bb) q\u2082.\n\nBut since quartile(x) is non-decreasing, quartile(\u03bb\u03b2\u2081 + (1 - \u03bb)\u03b2\u2082) \u2264 quartile(\u03b2\u2081) = q\u2081 if \u03bb\u03b2\u2081 + (1 - \u03bb)\u03b2\u2082 \u2264 \u03b2\u2081, which is not necessarily true. Wait, no, actually, if \u03b2\u2081 < \u03b2\u2082, then \u03bb\u03b2\u2081 + (1 - \u03bb)\u03b2\u2082 is between \u03b2\u2081 and \u03b2\u2082. So, quartile(\u03bb\u03b2\u2081 + (1 - \u03bb)\u03b2\u2082) is between q\u2081 and q\u2082. So, it's less than or equal to q\u2082 and greater than or equal to q\u2081.\n\nBut the line segment between (\u03b2\u2081, q\u2081) and (\u03b2\u2082, q\u2082) is a straight line. So, for any point on the line segment, the value is between q\u2081 and q\u2082. But quartile(x) is non-decreasing, so quartile(\u03bb\u03b2\u2081 + (1 - \u03bb)\u03b2\u2082) is between q\u2081 and q\u2082. So, the line segment lies above quartile(x) because quartile(x) is non-decreasing. Wait, no, actually, quartile(x) is non-decreasing, so the line segment lies above it only if the line is above the function.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about the definition of convexity. For a function to be convex, the line segment between any two points on the function lies above the function. So, if I take two points on the function, say (\u03b2\u2081, q\u2081) and (\u03b2\u2082, q\u2082), with \u03b2\u2081 < \u03b2\u2082, then the line segment connecting them should lie above the function between \u03b2\u2081 and \u03b2\u2082.\n\nBut since the function is constant on [\u03b2\u2081, \u03b2\u2082), the line segment will lie above the function because the function is flat. So, quartile(x) is convex? Wait, but quartile(x) is non-decreasing, which is a weaker condition than convexity. Wait, no, quartile(x) is a step function, which is both convex and concave? Or is it?\n\nWait, actually, a step function can be both convex and concave depending on the points. For example, a step function that increases at certain points is convex, and a step function that decreases is concave. But in this case, quartile(x) is non-decreasing, so it's convex. Is that right?\n\nWait, let me think again. If a function is non-decreasing and its increments are non-decreasing, then it's convex. Similarly, if it's non-increasing and increments are non-increasing, it's concave. But quartile(x) is non-decreasing, but I don't know if its increments are non-decreasing.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose we have a random variable x with probabilities p\u2081, p\u2082, p\u2083, etc., such that the quartile jumps at certain points. Let's say p\u2081 = 0.25, p\u2082 = 0.5, p\u2083 = 0.25. Then, quartile(x) would be 0.25 because prob(x \u2264 0.25) = 0.25. Then, if we increase \u03b2 beyond 0.25, prob(x \u2264 \u03b2) becomes 0.5, so quartile(x) jumps to 0.5. Then, if we increase \u03b2 further, prob(x \u2264 \u03b2) remains 0.5, so quartile(x) stays at 0.5. So, in this case, quartile(x) is a step function"
