The question is asking which of the given sets are convex, specifically the set of points closer to a given point x\u2080 than to any point in another set S. The set is defined as {x | ||x - x\u2080||\u2082 \u2264 ||x - y||\u2082 for all y \u2208 S}, where S is a subset of R\u207f. Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that a set is convex if, for any two points in the set, the line segment connecting them is entirely contained within the set. So, I need to check if this particular set satisfies that condition.\n\nLet me denote the set in question as C. So, C = {x | ||x - x\u2080||\u2082 \u2264 ||x - y||\u2082 for all y \u2208 S}. This looks like the set of all points x that are closer to x\u2080 than to any point in S. I think this is related to the concept of a Voronoi region or maybe the set of points closer to a specific point than another set.\n\nWait, actually, this set C is the set of points closer to x\u2080 than to any point in S. So, if I pick any two points x\u2081 and x\u2082 in C, I need to check if the entire line segment between x\u2081 and x\u2082 is also in C.\n\nLet me consider two arbitrary points x\u2081 and x\u2082 in C. That means for both x\u2081 and x\u2082, the distance to x\u2080 is less than or equal to their distance to any point in S. So, ||x\u2081 - x\u2080|| \u2264 ||x\u2081 - y|| for all y \u2208 S, and similarly for x\u2082.\n\nNow, I need to see if for any \u03bb \u2208 [0,1], the point x = \u03bbx\u2081 + (1 - \u03bb)x\u2082 is also in C. That is, does ||x - x\u2080|| \u2264 ||x - y|| for all y \u2208 S?\n\nLet me compute ||x - x\u2080||. Since x is a convex combination of x\u2081 and x\u2082, we can write x = \u03bbx\u2081 + (1 - \u03bb)x\u2082. Then, ||x - x\u2080|| = ||\u03bbx\u2081 + (1 - \u03bb)x\u2082 - x\u2080||.\n\nI can rewrite this as ||\u03bb(x\u2081 - x\u2080) + (1 - \u03bb)(x\u2082 - x\u2080)||. Using the triangle inequality, this is \u2264 \u03bb||x\u2081 - x\u2080|| + (1 - \u03bb)||x\u2082 - x\u2080||.\n\nBut since x\u2081 and x\u2082 are in C, we know that ||x\u2081 - x\u2080|| \u2264 ||x\u2081 - y|| and ||x\u2082 - x\u2080|| \u2264 ||x\u2082 - y|| for all y \u2208 S. So, substituting these into the inequality, we get:\n\n||x - x\u2080|| \u2264 \u03bb||x\u2081 - y|| + (1 - \u03bb)||x\u2082 - y||.\n\nHmm, but I need to compare this to ||x - y|| for any y \u2208 S. Let me see if I can relate ||x - y|| to ||x - x\u2080|| and ||x\u2081 - x\u2082||.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the reverse triangle inequality or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the definition of C. Since C consists of points closer to x\u2080 than to any point in S, it's like the region where x\u2080 is the nearest point in S. This set is known as the Voronoi cell for x\u2080 with respect to S.\n\nI recall that Voronoi cells are convex sets. Is that right? Let me think. If I have a Voronoi cell, it's the set of points closer to x\u2080 than to any other point in S. Since the Voronoi diagram partitions the space into regions based on proximity to each point in S, each region should be convex. Because any line segment between two points in the same Voronoi cell will stay entirely within that cell, meaning all points on the segment are closer to x\u2080 than to any other point in S.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the function f(x) = ||x - x\u2080||\u00b2 - ||x - y||\u00b2 for some y \u2208 S. If I can show that f(x) is convex, then the set where f(x) \u2264 0 is convex. But wait, f(x) is linear in x, right? Because the squared norm is quadratic, but when subtracted, it becomes linear. So, f(x) is affine, not convex or concave. Hmm, maybe that approach isn't the best.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the definition of convexity again. For C to be convex, for any x\u2081, x\u2082 \u2208 C and \u03bb \u2208 [0,1], \u03bbx + (1 - \u03bb)y must also be in C. So, I need to show that ||\u03bbx + (1 - \u03bb)y - x\u2080|| \u2264 ||\u03bbx + (1 - \u03bb)y - z|| for all z \u2208 S.\n\nBut since x and y are in C, we know that ||x - x\u2080|| \u2264 ||x - z|| and ||y - x\u2080|| \u2264 ||y - z|| for all z \u2208 S. So, maybe I can use some inequality here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the set C is the intersection of half-spaces. Specifically, for each y \u2208 S, the condition ||x - x\u2080|| \u2264 ||x - y|| defines a half-space. The intersection of all these half-spaces would be C. Since the intersection of convex sets is convex, and each half-space is convex, then C is convex.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Each inequality ||x - x\u2080|| \u2264 ||x - y|| defines a half-space. For example, if I rearrange ||x - x\u2080|| \u2264 ||x - y||, I can square both sides (since both sides are non-negative) to get ||x - x\u2080||\u00b2 \u2264 ||x - y||\u00b2. Expanding both sides:\n\n(x - x\u2080)\u00b7(x - x\u2080) \u2264 (x - y)\u00b7(x - y)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx\u00b7x - 2x\u00b7x\u2080 + x\u2080\u00b7x\u2080 \u2264 x\u00b7x - 2x\u00b7y + y\u00b7y\n\nSubtracting x\u00b7x from both sides:\n\n-2x\u00b7x\u2080 + x\u2080\u00b7x\u2080 \u2264 -2x\u00b7y + y\u00b7y\n\nRearranging:\n\n2x\u00b7y - 2x\u00b7x\u2080 \u2264 y\u00b7y - x\u2080\u00b7x\u2080\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nx\u00b7y - x\u00b7x\u2080 \u2264 (y\u00b7y - x\u2080\u00b7x\u2080)/2\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nx\u00b7(y - x\u2080) \u2264 (||y||\u00b2 - ||x\u2080||\u00b2)/2\n\nThis is a linear inequality in x, so each such inequality defines a half-space. The intersection of all these half-spaces is C, which is the set of points closer to x\u2080 than to any point in S. Since each half-space is convex, their intersection is also convex. Therefore, C is convex.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the set C is convex because it is the intersection of convex sets (each defined by a linear inequality), and the intersection of convex sets is convex.\n</think>\n\nThe set of points closer to a given point \\( x_0 \\) than to any point in a set \\( S \\) is convex. This is because each condition defining the set as closer to \\( x_0 \\) than to a point in \\( S \\) corresponds to a linear inequality, which defines a convex half-space. The intersection of convex sets is convex, so the entire set is convex.\n\n**Answer:** The set is convex."
