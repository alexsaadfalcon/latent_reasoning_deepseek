Hmm, let me try to visualize what \"the other way up\" means. I think it refers to triangles that are not pointing upwards but maybe downwards or in some other orientation. But since it's about combinatorics, I should probably think about how triangles can be formed in a grid or something.\n\nWait, maybe it's about counting triangles in a figure, like a grid of points or something. If it's about triangles in a grid, then the number of triangles can be calculated using binomial coefficients. Let me recall that in a grid, the number of triangles can be found by considering different sizes and orientations.\n\nBut the question specifically says \"the other way up.\" Maybe it's referring to triangles that are not right-angled but are instead pointing in some other direction, like acute or obtuse. Hmm, but how does that translate into counting? Maybe it's about counting all possible triangles regardless of their orientation, but just the number of triangles that are not right-angled.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about counting all triangles in a triangular grid or something. Let me think. If it's a triangular grid, the number of triangles can be calculated by considering different sizes of triangles. For example, in a triangular grid with n rows, the number of small triangles is n(n+2)(2n+1)/8 or something like that? Wait, no, that might be for something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about counting all possible triangles in a square grid. In a square grid, the number of triangles can be calculated by considering different base lengths and different heights. For example, in an m x n grid, the number of triangles can be found by choosing two points as the base and then choosing a third point not on the base to form a triangle.\n\nBut the problem mentions \"the other way up,\" which might mean triangles that are not pointing upwards but downwards. So maybe it's about counting all triangles that are not right-angled, or perhaps triangles that are oriented in a different direction.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about counting all possible triangles in a triangular lattice, which is a grid of points arranged in equilateral triangles. In such a grid, the number of triangles can be calculated by considering different sizes and orientations.\n\nLet me try to recall the formula for the number of triangles in a triangular grid. If I have a triangular grid with side length n, the number of small triangles is n(n+2)(2n+1)/8. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Maybe I should derive it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about counting all possible triangles in a grid where each triangle is formed by three non-collinear points. So, if I have a grid with m rows and n columns, the number of triangles would be the number of ways to choose three non-collinear points.\n\nBut the problem is about \"the other way up,\" which is a bit vague. Maybe it's about counting all triangles that are not right-angled. So, in a grid, the number of right-angled triangles can be calculated by considering different legs and hypotenuses.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about counting all triangles in a grid where each triangle is formed by three points, regardless of orientation. So, in that case, the number of triangles would be the combination of points taken three at a time, minus the number of collinear triplets.\n\nBut the problem says \"the other way up,\" which might mean triangles that are not pointing upwards, so maybe they are pointing downwards. So, perhaps it's about counting all triangles that are not right-angled and pointing in some other direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about counting all triangles in a triangular grid, regardless of their orientation. So, in a triangular grid with side length n, the number of triangles can be calculated by considering different sizes and orientations.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about counting all possible triangles in a grid where each triangle is formed by three points, and the grid is a triangular lattice. In such a case, the number of triangles can be calculated by considering different sizes of triangles, both pointing up and pointing down.\n\nBut the problem specifically says \"the other way up,\" so maybe it's about triangles that are not pointing upwards. So, perhaps it's about counting all triangles that are pointing downwards.\n\nWait, maybe it's about counting all triangles in a square grid, but oriented in a different way. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about counting all possible triangles in a grid where each triangle is formed by three points, and the grid is a triangular lattice. So, in such a grid, the number of triangles can be calculated by considering different sizes and orientations.\n\nLet me try to think of a specific example. Suppose we have a triangular grid with side length 2. How many triangles can we form? Let's see.\n\nIn a triangular grid with side length 2, there are 3 rows. The number of small triangles is 6. Then, there are larger triangles. For example, in a 2x2 grid, there are 4 triangles pointing upwards and 1 triangle pointing downwards. So, total of 5 triangles.\n\nWait, but that's just an example. The problem is asking for a general formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about counting all possible triangles in a grid where each triangle is formed by three points, and the grid is a triangular lattice. So, in such a grid, the number of triangles can be calculated by considering different sizes and orientations.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about counting all possible triangles in a grid where each triangle is formed by three points, and the grid is a triangular lattice.

But I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, let me try to think differently. Maybe it's about counting all possible triangles in a grid where each triangle is formed by three points, and the grid is a triangular lattice. So, in such a grid, the number of triangles can be calculated by considering different sizes and orientations.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about counting all possible triangles in a grid where each triangle is formed by three points, and the grid is a triangular lattice.

So, in such a grid, the number of triangles can be calculated by considering different sizes and orientations.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that in a triangular grid with side length n, the number of triangles is the sum of the number of triangles of each possible size. For each size k (where k ranges from 1 to n), the number of triangles of that size is 2n - 2k + 1. So, the total number of triangles would be the sum from k=1 to k=n of (2n -"
