Express the closed convex set {x \u2208 R^2_+ | x_1x_2 \u2265 1} as an intersection of halfspaces.\n<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c>\n<think>\n<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I need to express the closed convex set {x \u2208 R\u00b2\u208a | x\u2081x\u2082 \u2265 1} as an intersection of halfspaces. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that a halfspace in R\u00b2 is defined by an inequality like a\u2081x\u2081 + a\u2082x\u2082 \u2265 b. So, I need to find a set of such inequalities that together define the region where x\u2081x\u2082 is at least 1.\n\nI remember that for inequalities involving products of variables, especially in two dimensions, we can sometimes use supporting hyperplanes. Maybe I can find a hyperplane that touches the boundary of the region at a point where x\u2081x\u2082 = 1.\n\nLet me consider the boundary of the region, which is the curve x\u2081x\u2082 = 1. This is a hyperbola in the first quadrant since we're dealing with R\u00b2\u208a. To find a supporting hyperplane at a point (a, b) on this hyperbola, I need a linear inequality that touches the hyperbola at (a, b) and lies entirely on one side.\n\nThe gradient of the function f(x\u2081, x\u2082) = x\u2081x\u2082 at a point (a, b) is (b, a), which gives the normal vector to the tangent line at that point. So, the equation of the tangent line (which is the supporting hyperplane) can be written as b(x\u2081 - a) + a(x\u2082 - b) = 0. Simplifying this, it becomes b x\u2081 + a x\u2082 = b a + a b, which simplifies further to b x\u2081 + a x\u2082 = 2 a b.\n\nBut wait, since we're in the first quadrant and the region is x\u2081x\u2082 \u2265 1, the supporting hyperplane should lie below the hyperbola. So, the inequality would be b x\u2081 + a x\u2082 \u2264 2 a b. But since we're in the first quadrant, both a and b are positive, so this inequality makes sense.\n\nNow, to express the entire region as an intersection of such hyperplanes, I need to find all possible supporting hyperplanes. However, since the hyperbola is unbounded, there isn't a finite number of hyperplanes that can cover the entire region. Instead, I think we can parameterize the hyperplanes based on a point (a, 1/a) on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, for each a > 0, the supporting hyperplane at (a, 1/a) is given by (1/a) x\u2081 + a x\u2082 \u2264 2 a*(1/a) = 2. Simplifying, this becomes (1/a) x\u2081 + a x\u2082 \u2264 2.\n\nTherefore, the region {x \u2208 R\u00b2\u208a | x\u2081x\u2082 \u2265 1} can be expressed as the intersection of all such halfspaces for a > 0. In mathematical terms, it's the set of all points (x\u2081, x\u2082) in R\u00b2\u208a such that for every a > 0, (1/a) x\u2081 + a x\u2082 \u2264 2.\n\nI should check if this makes sense. For any point (x\u2081, x\u2082) in the region, x\u2081x\u2082 \u2265 1. If I plug in the supporting hyperplane inequality, (1/a) x\u2081 + a x\u2082 \u2264 2, does it hold for all a > 0?\n\nLet me test a specific point, say (2, 0.5). Here, x\u2081x\u2082 = 2*0.5 = 1, which satisfies the condition. Plugging into the inequality: (1/a)*2 + a*(0.5) \u2264 2. For a = 2, this becomes (1/2)*2 + 2*(0.5) = 1 + 1 = 2 \u2264 2, which holds as equality.\n\nAnother point, say (3, 1/3). x\u2081x\u2082 = 1, so it's on the boundary. The inequality becomes (1/a)*3 + a*(1/3) \u2264 2. For a = 3, it's (1/3)*3 + 3*(1/3) = 1 + 1 = 2 \u2264 2, again equality.\n\nWhat about a point inside the region, like (2, 1). x\u2081x\u2082 = 2*1 = 2 \u2265 1. Plugging into the inequality: (1/a)*2 + a*1 \u2264 2. For a = 2, it's (1/2)*2 + 2*1 = 1 + 2 = 3 \u2264 2? Wait, that's not true. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. If I take a point inside the region, say (2, 1), which satisfies x\u2081x\u2082 = 2 \u2265 1, but plugging into the inequality (1/a)x\u2081 + a x\u2082 \u2264 2 gives 1 + 2 = 3 \u2264 2, which is false. That suggests that my earlier reasoning might be flawed.\n\nPerhaps I need to reconsider the direction of the inequality. Since the hyperbola is x\u2081x\u2082 = 1, and the region is x\u2081x\u2082 \u2265 1, the supporting hyperplane should lie above the hyperbola. So, maybe the inequality should be (1/a)x\u2081 + a x\u2082 \u2265 2 instead of \u2264 2.\n\nLet me test this with the point (2, 1). If the inequality is (1/a)x\u2081 + a x\u2082 \u2265 2, then for a = 2, it becomes (1/2)*2 + 2*1 = 1 + 2 = 3 \u2265 2, which holds. For the point (3, 1/3), it's (1/3)*3 + 3*(1/3) = 1 + 1 = 2 \u2265 2, which holds as equality. For the point (2, 0.5), it's (1/2)*2 + 2*(0.5) = 1 + 1 = 2 \u2265 2, which holds as equality.\n\nWait, but for the point (1,1), which is on the hyperbola, the inequality becomes (1/a)*1 + a*1 \u2265 2. For a = 1, it's 1 + 1 = 2 \u2265 2, which holds as equality.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct inequality is (1/a)x\u2081 + a x\u2082 \u2265 2. That way, the supporting hyperplane lies above the hyperbola, and the region is the intersection of all such hyperplanes for a > 0.\n\nTherefore, the closed convex set {x \u2208 R\u00b2\u208a | x\u2081x\u2082 \u2265 1} can be expressed as the intersection over all a > 0 of the halfspaces (1/a)x\u2081 + a x\u2082 \u2265 2.\n\nI think that makes sense because as a varies, the hyperplanes move and cover the entire region where x\u2081x\u2082 is at least 1. Each hyperplane touches the hyperbola at a specific point (a, 1/a) and lies above it, ensuring that all points in the region satisfy the inequality for all a > 0.\n\nSo, the final expression is the intersection of all halfspaces defined by (1/a)x\u2081 + a x\u2082 \u2265 2 for every a > 0.\n</think>\n\nThe closed convex set {x \u2208 R\u00b2\u208a | x\u2081x\u2082 \u2265 1} can be expressed as the intersection of all halfspaces defined by the inequality (1/a)x\u2081 + a x\u2082 \u2265 2 for every a > 0. Therefore, the set is:\n\n{ x \u2208 R\u00b2\u208a | x\u2081x\u2082 \u2265 1 } = \u2229_{a>0} { (x\u2081, x\u2082) \u2208 R\u00b2\u208a | (1/a)x\u2081 + a x\u2082 \u2265 2 }\n\n**Answer:** The closed convex set is the intersection of all halfspaces (1/a)x\u2081 + a x\u2082 \u2265 2 for a > 0. So, the final expression is:\n\n{ x \u2208 R\u00b2\u208a | x\u2081x\u2082 \u2265 1 } = \u2229_{a>0} { (x\u2081, x\u2082) \u2208 R\u00b2\u208a | (1/a)x\u2081 + a x\u2082 \u2265 2 }\n\n\\boxed{ \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2_+ \\mid x_1 x_2 \\geq 1 \\} = \\bigcap_{a>0} \\left\\{ (x_1, x_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2_+ \\mid \\frac{1}{a}x_1 + a x_2 \\geq 2 \\right\\} }"
