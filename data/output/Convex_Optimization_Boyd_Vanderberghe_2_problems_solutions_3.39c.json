    "problem": "Conjugate and minimization. Let f(x, z) be convex in (x, z) and define g(x) = inf_z f(x, z). Express the conjugate g* in terms of f*. As an application, express the conjugate of g(x) = inf_z{h(z) | Az + b = x}, where h is convex, in terms of h*, A, and b.",
    "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to find the conjugate of a function g, which is defined as the infimum of another function f over some variable z. The function f is convex in both x and z, and g is given by g(x) = inf_z f(x, z). Then, I need to express g* in terms of f*. After that, I have to apply this result to a specific case where g(x) is the infimum of h(z) subject to the linear constraint Az + b = x, and h is convex. \n\nAlright, let me start by recalling what the conjugate function is. The conjugate of a function f, denoted as f*, is defined as f*(y) = sup_x { y^T x - f(x) }, where the supremum is taken over all x in the domain of f. The conjugate function has some nice properties, like being convex and lower semi-continuous, and it's the convex dual of f.\n\nNow, g(x) is defined as the infimum of f(x, z) over z. So, g(x) is the minimum value of f(x, z) as z varies. Since f is convex in both x and z, I wonder if g is also convex? Well, infimum of convex functions isn't necessarily convex, but in this case, since f is convex in z for each x, and we're taking the infimum over z, which is a convex set (assuming z is in some convex set), then g should be convex. I think that's correct because for each x, f(x, z) is convex in z, so the infimum over z would also be convex.\n\nSo, g is convex. Therefore, its conjugate g* should be well-defined. Now, I need to express g* in terms of f*. Let me think about how to relate g and f.\n\nGiven that g(x) = inf_z f(x, z), I can write this as g(x) = min_z f(x, z). So, for each x, g(x) is the minimum value of f(x, z) over z. \n\nNow, the conjugate of g is g*(y) = sup_x { y^T x - g(x) }. Substituting g(x) into this, we get:\n\ng*(y) = sup_x { y^T x - inf_z f(x, z) }.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can interchange the supremum and infimum? I recall that sometimes you can switch them under certain conditions, especially if the functions are convex and lower semi-continuous. Let me check if that's applicable here.\n\nSince f is convex in both x and z, and g is convex, I think that f(x, z) is convex in (x, z). So, for each x, f(x, z) is convex in z, and for each z, f(x, z) is convex in x. Therefore, the infimum over z of f(x, z) is convex in x, which we already established.\n\nSo, perhaps I can write:\n\ng*(y) = sup_x { y^T x - inf_z f(x, z) }.\n\nBut I can interchange the infimum and the supremum if the functions are convex. Wait, is that a valid operation? Let me recall the Fenchel's duality theorem or some properties of conjugate functions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the definition of g* and see if I can express it in terms of f*. Let me think about the relationship between f and g.\n\nSince g(x) = inf_z f(x, z), then for each x, g(x) is the minimum of f(x, z) over z. So, if I fix x, then f(x, z) is convex in z, so the minimum is a convex function in x. Therefore, g is convex.\n\nNow, to find g*, which is the conjugate of g, we can write:\n\ng*(y) = sup_x { y^T x - g(x) }.\n\nBut g(x) is the infimum of f(x, z) over z, so substituting that in:\n\ng*(y) = sup_x { y^T x - inf_z f(x, z) }.\n\nNow, perhaps I can interchange the supremum and infimum. Let me see:\n\ng*(y) = sup_x { sup_z [ y^T x - f(x, z) ] }.\n\nWait, is that correct? Because inf_z f(x, z) is the lower bound, so y^T x - inf_z f(x, z) is greater than or equal to y^T x - f(x, z) for all z. Therefore, the supremum over x of y^T x - inf_z f(x, z) is greater than or equal to the supremum over x and z of y^T x - f(x, z). But I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that inf_z f(x, z) is the same as the minimum of f(x, z) over z, so perhaps I can write:\n\ng*(y) = sup_x { y^T x - min_z f(x, z) }.\n\nBut how does that relate to f*?\n\nWait, f is convex in both x and z, so f* is defined as f*(y) = sup_x { y^T x - f(x) }, but here, f is a function of two variables, so maybe I need to consider f* as a function of (x, z). Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.\n\nLet me try to think differently. Since g(x) = inf_z f(x, z), and f is convex in both x and z, perhaps g is the convex conjugate of f in some way. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider the definition of conjugate functions. The conjugate of a function is the supremum over linear functions. So, perhaps I can write g*(y) as the supremum over x of y^T x - g(x). But g(x) is the infimum of f(x, z), so:\n\ng*(y) = sup_x { y^T x - inf_z f(x, z) }.\n\nNow, since f is convex in z, for each x, f(x, z) is convex in z, so inf_z f(x, z) is convex in x. Therefore, g is convex.\n\nBut how do I relate this to f*? Maybe I can use the fact that f is convex in both variables, so perhaps f* can be expressed in terms of f.\n\nWait, f is convex in both x and z, so f* is the biconjugate of f, which is f itself if f is convex and lower semi-continuous. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that g(x) is the minimum of f(x, z) over z, so g is the infimum of f over z, which is similar to the definition of the conjugate function.\n\nWait, the conjugate function f* is defined as sup_x { y^T x - f(x) }, but here, f is a function of two variables, so maybe I need to consider f* as a function of (x, z). Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.\n\nWait, perhaps I can fix x and think of g(x) as the minimum over z of f(x, z). So, for each x, g(x) is the minimum of f(x, z) over z. Then, the conjugate g* is the supremum over x of y^T x - g(x). So, g*(y) = sup_x { y^T x - inf_z f(x, z) }.\n\nBut since f is convex in z, for each x, f(x, z) is convex in z, so the infimum over z is the minimum, which is a convex function in x. Therefore, g is convex.\n\nNow, to express g* in terms of f*, perhaps I can use the fact that g is the infimum of f over z, so g* is the supremum over x of y^T x - inf_z f(x, z). But I need to relate this to f*.\n\nWait, maybe I can write g*(y) as the supremum over x of y^T x - inf_z f(x, z).

Therefore, g is"
