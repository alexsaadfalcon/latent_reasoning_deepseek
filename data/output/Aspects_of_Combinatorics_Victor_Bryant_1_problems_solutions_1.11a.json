Hmm, let me first try to understand the structure of the array. It says the rows start with 1, then 1 2, then 1 2 3, and so on. So, the first row is just 1, the second row is 1, 2, the third row is 1, 2, 3, and so on. \n\nSo, each row n has n numbers, starting from 1 up to n. That makes sense. So, the first row is row 1: [1], the second row is row 2: [1, 2], the third row is row 3: [1, 2, 3], etc. \n\nNow, the problem is asking about the sum of the numbers in the rth row. So, for example, the sum of the first row (r=1) is 1, the sum of the second row (r=2) is 1+2=3, the sum of the third row (r=3) is 1+2+3=6, and so on. \n\nI need to find a general formula for this sum in terms of r. The problem states that this sum is equal to (r+1 choose 2). Let me verify that with the examples I have. \n\nFor r=1: (1+1 choose 2) = (2 choose 2) = 1. That matches the sum of the first row. \n\nFor r=2: (2+1 choose 2) = (3 choose 2) = 3. That matches the sum of the second row. \n\nFor r=3: (3+1 choose 2) = (4 choose 2) = 6. That also matches the sum of the third row. \n\nOkay, so that seems to hold for the first few rows. So, the formula seems correct. \n\nNow, I need to show that the sum of the numbers in the rth row is indeed (r+1 choose 2). Let me think about how to approach this. \n\nEach row n has numbers from 1 to n. So, the sum of the rth row is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + r. I remember that the sum of the first n natural numbers is given by the formula (n(n+1))/2. \n\nWait, so if the sum of the rth row is 1 + 2 + ... + r, that should be (r(r+1))/2. But the problem says it's (r+1 choose 2). Let me compute (r+1 choose 2). \n\nThe binomial coefficient (r+1 choose 2) is equal to ( (r+1) * r ) / 2, which is the same as (r(r+1))/2. So, yes, that's exactly the same as the sum of the first r natural numbers. \n\nTherefore, the sum of the rth row is indeed (r+1 choose 2). \n\nNow, the problem also asks to express the grand total of numbers in the array as a single binomial coefficient. Hmm, the grand total would be the sum of all the numbers in the array up to the rth row. So, I need to find the total sum from row 1 to row r.\n\nLet me denote the total sum as S(r). So, S(r) = sum_{k=1}^{r} [sum_{i=1}^{k} i]. \n\nI can rewrite this as S(r) = sum_{k=1}^{r} [k(k+1)/2]. \n\nSo, S(r) = (1/2) * sum_{k=1}^{r} [k^2 + k]. \n\nI know that sum_{k=1}^{r} k = (r(r+1))/2, and sum_{k=1}^{r} k^2 = (r(r+1)(2r+1))/6. \n\nSo, substituting these into S(r):\n\nS(r) = (1/2) * [ (r(r+1)(2r+1))/6 + (r(r+1))/2 ]\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the two sums inside the brackets:\n\nSum1 = sum_{k=1}^{r} k^2 = (r(r+1)(2r+1))/6\n\nSum2 = sum_{k=1}^{r} k = (r(r+1))/2\n\nSo, S(r) = (1/2)(Sum1 + Sum2) = (1/2)[ (r(r+1)(2r+1))/6 + (r(r+1))/2 ]\n\nLet me factor out (r(r+1))/2 from both terms inside the brackets:\n\n= (1/2) * [ (r(r+1))/2 * ( (2r+1)/3 + 1 ) ]\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nSum1 = (r(r+1)(2r+1))/6 = (r(r+1)/2) * (2r+1)/3\n\nSum2 = (r(r+1))/2\n\nSo, Sum1 + Sum2 = (r(r+1)/2) * [ (2r+1)/3 + 1 ]\n\nCompute the term in the brackets:\n\n(2r + 1)/3 + 1 = (2r + 1 + 3)/3 = (2r + 4)/3 = 2(r + 2)/3\n\nSo, Sum1 + Sum2 = (r(r+1)/2) * (2(r + 2)/3) = (r(r+1)/2) * (2(r + 2)/3)\n\nSimplify this:\n\nThe 2 in the numerator and denominator cancels out, so we have:\n\n= (r(r+1)/1) * ( (r + 2)/3 ) = (r(r+1)(r + 2))/3\n\nTherefore, S(r) = (1/2) * [ (r(r+1)(r + 2))/3 ] = (r(r+1)(r + 2))/6\n\nSo, S(r) = (r(r+1)(r + 2))/6\n\nNow, I need to express this as a single binomial coefficient. Let me recall that binomial coefficients have the form (n choose k). \n\nLooking at the expression (r(r+1)(r + 2))/6, I notice that this is equal to (r+2 choose 3). Let me verify that.\n\nThe binomial coefficient (r+2 choose 3) is equal to ( (r+2)(r+1)r ) / 6, which is exactly the same as (r(r+1)(r + 2))/6. \n\nTherefore, S(r) = (r+2 choose 3). \n\nSo, the grand total of numbers in the array up to the rth row is (r+2 choose 3).\n\nLet me recap:\n\n1. The sum of the rth row is (r+1 choose 2).\n2. The grand total is the sum of all rows up to r, which is (r+2 choose 3).\n\nI think that's it. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the sum of the rth row: 1 + 2 + ... + r = (r(r+1))/2 = (r+1 choose 2). That's correct.\n\nThen, the grand total is the sum from k=1 to r of (k(k+1))/2. That becomes (1/2) sum(k^2 + k). \n\nSum(k^2) is (r(r+1)(2r+1))/6, and sum(k) is (r(r+1))/2. \n\nAdding them together and factoring, I get (r(r+1)(r + 2))/6, which is (r+2 choose 3). That seems correct.\n\nSo, I think I did it right. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe grand total of numbers in the array is \\boxed{\\dbinom{r+2}{3}}.\n</think>\n\nTo show that the sum of the numbers in the \\( r \\)th row of the array is \\( \\binom{r+1}{2} \\):\n\n1.
