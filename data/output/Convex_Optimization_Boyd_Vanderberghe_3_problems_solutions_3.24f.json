First, I should clarify what \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\) represents. It could be a notation specific to a particular context or problem. Without additional information, I'll assume it's related to lexicographical ordering or a similar concept.\n\nNext, I'll consider the possibility that \\( K^* \\) denotes a set or sequence, and \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\) refers to its lexicographical order. To determine \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\), I need to know the elements of \\( K^* \\). If \\( K^* \\) is a sequence, I can compare elements lexicographically by their order in the dictionary.\n\nIf \\( K^* \\) is a set, \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\) might refer to the lexicographical order of its elements when arranged in a specific way, such as alphabetical or numerical order.\n\nSince the problem doesn't provide specific elements or context, I'll outline the steps to find \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\):\n1. Identify the elements of \\( K^* \\).\n2. Determine the order in which these elements should be arranged.\n3. Apply the lexicographical order to find \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\).\n\nWithout further information, I can't compute a specific answer, but these steps should guide the solution once the necessary details are known.\n</think>\n\nTo find \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\), we need to determine the lexicographical order of the elements in the set or sequence \\( K^* \\). Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Elements**: First, list out all the elements of \\( K^* \\). These elements could be numbers, words, or any other comparable entities.\n\n2. **Determine the Order**: Compare the elements lexicographically. This means arranging them in an order similar to dictionary sorting, where each element is compared one by one from left to right.\n\n3. **Apply Lexicographical Order**: Once all elements are compared, arrange them in the order determined by their lexicographical sequence.\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\\[\n\\boxed{K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\text{ is the lexicographical order of the elements in } K^*.}\n\\]"
