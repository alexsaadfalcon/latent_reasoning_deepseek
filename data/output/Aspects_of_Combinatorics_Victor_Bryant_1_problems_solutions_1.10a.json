(One such rectangle is highlighted: of course the rectangles must be at least one box wide and deep, and squares are allowed.)\n<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c>\n<think>\n<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many different rectangles can be seen in an n x n grid. Hmm, let me think about this step by step. I remember that in a grid, rectangles are formed by choosing two horizontal lines and two vertical lines. Each pair of horizontal lines and each pair of vertical lines will form a rectangle. \n\nWait, so in an n x n grid, how many horizontal and vertical lines are there? Well, if it's an n x n grid, there are (n+1) horizontal lines and (n+1) vertical lines because each cell is bounded by lines. For example, a 2x2 grid has 3 horizontal and 3 vertical lines.\n\nSo, to form a rectangle, I need to choose 2 horizontal lines and 2 vertical lines. The number of ways to choose 2 lines from (n+1) is given by the combination formula, which is C(n+1, 2). I think that's the same as (n+1)*n/2. \n\nSince I need to choose both horizontal and vertical lines, the total number of rectangles should be the product of these two combinations. So, it would be [C(n+1, 2)]^2. Let me write that out:\n\nNumber of rectangles = [C(n+1, 2)]^2\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me test this with a small value of n. Let's take n=2, which is a 2x2 grid. How many rectangles are there? \n\nIn a 2x2 grid, there are 4 small squares, 2 horizontal rectangles, 2 vertical rectangles, and 1 big rectangle. So total rectangles are 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9. \n\nUsing the formula, [C(3,2)]^2 = (3*2/2)^2 = (3)^2 = 9. That matches. \n\nLet me try n=3, a 3x3 grid. How many rectangles are there? \n\nIn a 3x3 grid, the number of rectangles can be calculated by the formula for the number of rectangles in an m x n grid, which is m(m+1)/2 * n(n+1)/2. So for 3x3, it's (3*4/2)*(3*4/2) = 6*6 = 36. \n\nUsing my formula, [C(4,2)]^2 = (6)^2 = 36. That also matches. \n\nWait, so is the formula [C(n+1, 2)]^2? Let me think again. \n\nC(n+1, 2) is the number of ways to choose two horizontal lines, and similarly for vertical lines. So, the total number of rectangles is indeed the product of these two, which is [C(n+1, 2)]^2. \n\nAlternatively, I can write this as [(n+1)n/2]^2. But maybe it's better to write it in terms of combinations. \n\nAlternatively, I remember that the number of rectangles in an n x n grid is also given by the sum from i=1 to n of the sum from j=1 to n of (n - i + 1)(n - j + 1). But that seems more complicated. \n\nWait, actually, that's another way to think about it. For each possible width and height, count the number of rectangles. For a width of k and height of l, the number of such rectangles is (n - k + 1)(n - l + 1). So, summing over all k and l from 1 to n gives the total number of rectangles. \n\nBut that's essentially the same as the combination approach because for each width k, there are (n - k + 1) choices, and similarly for height l. So, the total number is the sum over k=1 to n of (n - k + 1) * sum over l=1 to n of (n - l + 1). \n\nBut that's equal to [sum from k=1 to n of (n - k + 1)]^2, which is [n(n + 1)/2]^2, same as before. \n\nSo, both methods lead to the same formula. Therefore, the number of rectangles in an n x n grid is [C(n+1, 2)]^2, which simplifies to (n(n + 1)/2)^2. \n\nAlternatively, that can be written as [n(n + 1)/2]^2, which is the square of the nth triangular number. \n\nWait, just to make sure, let me test n=1. A 1x1 grid has 1 rectangle, which is correct. Using the formula, [1*2/2]^2 = (1)^2 = 1. Correct. \n\nn=4, a 4x4 grid. The number of rectangles should be [C(5,2)]^2 = (10)^2 = 100. Let me see, in a 4x4 grid, the number of rectangles is indeed 100. \n\nSo, I think the formula is correct. Therefore, the number of rectangles in an n x n grid is [n(n + 1)/2]^2. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is there another way to express this? Because sometimes, in combinatorics, the number of rectangles is given by the formula (n(n + 1)/2)^2, which is the square of the nth triangular number. \n\nAlternatively, it can also be written as (n^2(n + 1)^2)/4. \n\nSo, in conclusion, the number of rectangles in an n x n grid is [n(n + 1)/2]^2. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of different rectangles in an \\( n \\times n \\) grid is \\boxed{\\left( \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\right)^2}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many different rectangles can be seen in an \\( n \\times n \\) grid, we start by noting that a rectangle is formed by choosing two horizontal lines and two vertical lines. \n\nIn an \\( n \\times n \\) grid, there are \\( n + 1 \\) horizontal lines and \\( n + 1 \\) vertical lines.
