    "problem": "Conjugate of perspective. Express the conjugate of the perspective of a convex function f in terms of f*.",
    "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this math problem to solve: I need to find the conjugate of the perspective of a convex function f, and express it in terms of f*. Hmm, let me try to remember what all these terms mean.\n\nFirst, what is a convex function? A function f: R^n \u2192 R is convex if, for any two points x and y in its domain and any \u03bb in [0,1], the function satisfies f(\u03bbx + (1-\u03bb)y) \u2264 \u03bbf(x) + (1-\u03bb)f(y). So, it's like the line segment between any two points on the graph of the function lies above or on the graph.\n\nNow, what is the conjugate function, or the Fenchel conjugate? If f is a convex function, its conjugate f* is defined as f*(y) = sup{\u27e8x, y\u27e9 - f(x) | x \u2208 dom f}, where dom f is the domain of f. The conjugate function is a way to represent the convex function in terms of its linear functionals.\n\nNext, what is the perspective of a function? I think the perspective of a function f is defined as f_t(x) = t f(x/t) for t > 0. So, it's a scaling of the function f by a factor of t, but scaled down by t in the argument. This is often used in optimization to transform problems into more manageable forms.\n\nSo, the problem is asking for the conjugate of the perspective of f, which is (f_t)*, and to express it in terms of f*. Let me write that down:\n\nWe need to find (f_t)* = sup{\u27e8x, y\u27e9 - f_t(x) | x \u2208 dom f_t}.\n\nBut f_t(x) is t f(x/t), so substituting that in, we get:\n\n(f_t)* = sup{\u27e8x, y\u27e9 - t f(x/t) | x \u2208 dom f_t}.\n\nHmm, okay. So, I need to express this supremum in terms of f*. Maybe I can manipulate the expression inside the supremum to relate it to f*.\n\nLet me try to make a substitution. Let me set z = x/t. Then, x = t z. So, substituting back, the expression becomes:\n\n\u27e8t z, y\u27e9 - t f(z) = t \u27e8z, y\u27e9 - t f(z) = t (\u27e8z, y\u27e9 - f(z)).\n\nSo, the supremum becomes:\n\nsup{ t (\u27e8z, y\u27e9 - f(z)) | z \u2208 dom f_t }.\n\nBut dom f_t is the same as dom f, since scaling the argument doesn't change the domain. So, we can write:\n\n(f_t)* = sup{ t (\u27e8z, y\u27e9 - f(z)) | z \u2208 dom f }.\n\nHmm, so that's t times the supremum of \u27e8z, y\u27e9 - f(z) over z in dom f. But the supremum of \u27e8z, y\u27e9 - f(z) is exactly f*(y), right? Because f*(y) is defined as sup{\u27e8z, y\u27e9 - f(z) | z \u2208 dom f}.\n\nSo, substituting that in, we get:\n\n(f_t)* = t f*(y).\n\nWait, so is that it? The conjugate of the perspective of f is just t times the conjugate of f evaluated at y? That seems too straightforward. Let me double-check.\n\nStarting from the definition:\n\n(f_t)* = sup{\u27e8x, y\u27e9 - f_t(x) | x \u2208 dom f_t}.\n\nBut f_t(x) = t f(x/t), so:\n\n= sup{\u27e8x, y\u27e9 - t f(x/t) | x \u2208 dom f_t}.\n\nLet x = t z, so z = x/t, and x = t z. Then, substituting:\n\n= sup{\u27e8t z, y\u27e9 - t f(z) | z \u2208 dom f}.\n\n= sup{ t \u27e8z, y\u27e9 - t f(z) | z \u2208 dom f}.\n\n= t sup{ \u27e8z, y\u27e9 - f(z) | z \u2208 dom f }.\n\n= t f*(y).\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the conjugate of the perspective of f is t times the conjugate of f evaluated at y.\n\nWait, but is this always true? Let me think about the properties of conjugate functions. The conjugate function is homogeneous of degree 1, meaning that if you scale the argument by a factor t, the conjugate scales by t as well. So, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the perspective function f_t(x) = t f(x/t), then the conjugate f_t* should be related to f*. Since the conjugate is a linear operator in a certain sense, scaling the argument should scale the conjugate accordingly.\n\nLet me consider a simple example to verify. Let f(x) = (1/2)||x||^2, which is a convex function. Its conjugate is f*(y) = (1/2)||y||^2.\n\nNow, let's take t = 2. Then f_t(x) = 2 f(x/2) = 2*(1/2)||x/2||^2 = (1/2)||x/2||^2 * 2 = (1/2)*(x/2)^2 * 2 = (1/2)*(x^2 /4)*2 = (1/4)x^2.\n\nWait, that seems like f_t(x) = (1/4)x^2, which is just f(x) scaled by 1/2. Hmm, but in this case, f_t(x) = t f(x/t) = 2 f(x/2) = 2*(1/2)||x/2||^2 = (1/2)||x/2||^2 * 2 = (1/2)*(x^2 /4)*2 = (1/4)x^2. So, f_t(x) = (1/4)x^2.\n\nThen, the conjugate of f_t should be f_t*(y) = (1/4)||y||^2. On the other hand, t f*(y) = 2*(1/2)||y||^2 = ||y||^2. Wait, but (1/4)||y||^2 is not equal to ||y||^2. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the example. Let me recalculate.\n\nf(x) = (1/2)||x||^2, so f*(y) = (1/2)||y||^2.\n\nThen, f_t(x) = t f(x/t) = t*(1/2)||x/t||^2 = (t/2)*(x/t)^2 = (t/2)*(x^2 / t^2) = (1/2)*(x^2 / t).\n\nSo, f_t(x) = (1/(2t))x^2.\n\nThen, the conjugate of f_t is f_t*(y) = sup{\u27e8x, y\u27e9 - f_t(x) | x \u2208 R^n}.\n\nCompute that:\n\n= sup{\u27e8x, y\u27e9 - (1/(2t))x^2 }.\n\nThis is a quadratic in x. Let's write it as:\n\n= sup{ - (1/(2t))x^2 + \u27e8x, y\u27e9 }.\n\nTo find the supremum, take derivative with respect to x and set to zero:\n\nd/dx [ - (1/(2t))x^2 + \u27e8x, y\u27e9 ] = - (1/t)x + y = 0.\n\nSo, x = t y.\n\nSubstitute back into the expression:\n\n= - (1/(2t))(t y)^2 + \u27e8t y, y\u27e9 = - (1/(2t))(t^2 ||y||^2) + t \u27e8y, y\u27e9 = - (t/2) ||y||^2 + t ||y||^2 = (t/2) ||y||^2.\n\nSo, f_t*(y) = (t/2)||y||^2.\n\nBut according to our earlier result, t f*(y) should be equal to f_t*(y). Since f*(y) = (1/2)||y||^2, then t f*(y) = t*(1/2)||y||^2 = (t/2)||y||^2, which matches f_t*(y). So, in this case, it works.\n\nWait, so in my initial calculation, I must have made a mistake when I thought f_t(x) was (1/4)x^2. Actually, f_t(x) is (1/(2t))x^2, not (1/4)x^2. So, my mistake was in the substitution.\n\nSo, in the example, f_t*(y) = (t/2)||y||^2, which is indeed t times f*(y). So, the formula holds.\n\nAnother example: Let f(x) = |x|, which is convex. Its conjugate is f*(y) = max(0, y^2 / 4). Wait, no, actually, for f(x) = |x|, the conjugate is f*(y) = 0 if |y| \u2264 1, and (y^2)/4 otherwise. Wait, no, actually, f*(y) = sup{\u27e8x, y\u27e9 - |x| | x \u2208 R}.\n\nCompute that: For y positive, the supremum is achieved at x = y, giving y^2 - y."
