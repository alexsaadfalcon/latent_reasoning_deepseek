The set in question is defined as {x | dist(x, S) \u2264 dist(x, T)}, where S and T are subsets of R^n, and dist(x, S) is the distance from x to the set S. \n\nFirst, I should recall what a convex set is. A set is convex if, for any two points within the set, the line segment connecting them is entirely contained within the set. So, if I take any two points x and y in the set, then for any \u03bb between 0 and 1, the point \u03bbx + (1 - \u03bb)y should also be in the set.\n\nNow, the set we're looking at is all points x where the distance from x to S is less than or equal to the distance from x to T. Let me denote this set as C. So, C = {x | dist(x, S) \u2264 dist(x, T)}.\n\nI need to check if C is convex. To do this, I should consider two arbitrary points x and y in C and see if the point z = \u03bbx + (1 - \u03bb)y is also in C for any \u03bb in [0,1].\n\nLet me denote d_S(x) = dist(x, S) and d_T(x) = dist(x, T). Since x and y are in C, we have d_S(x) \u2264 d_S(y) and d_T(x) \u2264 d_T(y).\n\nI need to compare d_S(z) and d_T(z) where z = \u03bbx + (1 - \u03bb)y. The distance from z to S is the infimum of ||z - s|| for s in S, and similarly for T.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure how to directly compare d_S(z) and d_T(z) with d_S(x) and d_T(x). Maybe I should think about the properties of the distance function. The distance function is known to be convex, meaning that d_S(\u03bbx + (1 - \u03bb)y) \u2264 \u03bbd_S(x) + (1 - \u03bb)d_S(y). Similarly for d_T.\n\nSince d_S(x) \u2264 d_S(y) and d_T(x) \u2264 d_T(y), then \u03bbd_S(x) + (1 - \u03bb)d_S(y) \u2264 \u03bbd_S(y) + (1 - \u03bb)d_S(x) = d_S(z) + something? Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the difference in distances. Let me define d_S(x) - d_S(y) \u2264 d_S(z) - d_S(x) and d_T(x) - d_T(y) \u2264 d_T(z) - d_T(x). But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the set C. It's the set of points where the distance to S is less than or equal to the distance to T. This set is actually the region where S is closer than T. I think this set is called the \"bisector\" between S and T. \n\nNow, is this bisector set convex? I recall that the bisector between two convex sets is not necessarily convex. For example, if S and T are both convex, their bisector might not be convex. But wait, in this case, S and T are arbitrary subsets, not necessarily convex. So, the convexity of C depends on the properties of S and T.\n\nWait, but the problem statement doesn't specify whether S and T are convex or not. It just says S, T \u2286 R^n. So, I might need to consider different cases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of specific examples. Let's say S and T are both closed balls. Then, the set C would be the set of points closer to S than to T. If S and T are concentric balls, then C would be the region between them, which is a convex set because it's a half-space. But if S and T are not concentric, then C might not be convex.\n\nWait, no, actually, if S and T are two concentric balls, then the set of points closer to S than to T is the region inside S, which is convex. But if S and T are not concentric, then the set C might not be convex. For example, if S is a single point and T is a larger set, then C would be the set of points closer to the single point than to T, which might not be convex.\n\nWait, let me think again. If S is a single point, say s, and T is a convex set, then the set C would be the set of points closer to s than to T. This is known as the Voronoi region for the point s with respect to T. I think this region is convex because it's defined by a linear inequality. Specifically, the distance from x to s is less than the distance from x to T. The distance from x to T is the minimum distance from x to any point in T. So, the condition dist(x, s) \u2264 dist(x, T) can be written as ||x - s|| \u2264 inf_{t \u2208 T} ||x - t||.\n\nSquaring both sides (since norms are non-negative), we get ||x - s||\u00b2 \u2264 (inf_{t \u2208 T} ||x - t||)\u00b2. But the right-hand side is the square of the minimum distance, which is less than or equal to the square of any distance from x to a point in T. So, for any t \u2208 T, ||x - s||\u00b2 \u2264 ||x - t||\u00b2. \n\nExpanding both sides, we have ||x||\u00b2 - 2x\u00b7s + ||s||\u00b2 \u2264 ||x||\u00b2 - 2x\u00b7t + ||t||\u00b2. Simplifying, we get -2x\u00b7s + ||s||\u00b2 \u2264 -2x\u00b7t + ||t||\u00b2. Bringing all terms to one side: -2x\u00b7s + 2x\u00b7t + ||s||\u00b2 - ||t||\u00b2 \u2264 0. Factoring out x: 2x\u00b7(t - s) + (||s||\u00b2 - ||t||\u00b2) \u2264 0.\n\nThis is a linear inequality in x, so the set C is a half-space, which is convex. Therefore, if S is a single point and T is convex, then C is convex.\n\nBut what if S is not a single point? For example, suppose S is a line and T is another line. Then, the set C would be the region closer to S than to T. Depending on the orientation of S and T, this region might not be convex. For instance, if S and T are two parallel lines, the region closer to S than to T is a strip between them, which is convex. But if S and T are not parallel, the region might be more complicated.\n\nWait, actually, if S and T are two parallel lines, the set C is the region between them, which is convex. But if S and T are not parallel, say S is a horizontal line and T is a vertical line, then the set C would be the region closer to the horizontal line than to the vertical line. This region is actually the area where the distance to the horizontal line is less than the distance to the vertical line. This region is a V-shaped region, which is not convex because if you take two points on either side of the V, the line segment connecting them might go outside the V.\n\nTherefore, in this case, C is not convex. So, if S and T are not parallel, C might not be convex.\n\nWait, but in the case where S and T are both convex sets, is C necessarily convex? Let me think. If S and T are both convex, then the set C is the set of points closer to S than to T. I think this set is called the \"bisector\" and it's known to be convex. Wait, is that true?\n\nWait, no, actually, the bisector between two convex sets is not necessarily convex. For example, if S and T are two disjoint convex sets, their bisector might not be convex. But if S and T are overlapping or one is inside the other, the bisector could be convex.\n\nWait, let me think of an example. Suppose S is a disk centered at the origin with radius 1, and T is a disk centered at (2,0) with radius 1. Then, the bisector set C would be the set of points closer to S than to T. Visually, this would be the region between the two disks. But since the disks are overlapping, the bisector might actually be the entire space between them, which is convex.\n\nWait, no, actually, if S is the disk at (0,0) and T is the disk at (2,0), then the bisector is the set of points closer to S than to T. The boundary between them is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment connecting the centers, which is the line x=1. So, the bisector is the region x < 1, which is a half-space, hence convex.\n\nBut wait, if S and T are both disks but not overlapping, say S is at (0,0) with radius 1, and T is at (3,0) with radius 1. Then, the bisector would be the region closer to S than to T, which is x < 1.5, which is still convex.\n\nWait, but if S and T are overlapping, say both are disks centered at (1,0) with radius 1, then the bisector would be the entire plane, which is convex.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing something. Let me think again"
