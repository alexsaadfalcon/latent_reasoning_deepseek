First, I should clarify what \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\) represents. It might be a notation specific to a particular context, such as combinatorics or order theory.\n\nAssuming \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\) refers to the lexicographical order, I should consider how to compare elements in a sequence. Lexicographical order is similar to dictionary order, where elements are compared one by one from left to right.\n\nIf \\( K \\) represents a set of sequences or strings, then \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\) would be the set of all finite sequences over \\( K \\) ordered lexicographically. This means each sequence is compared element by element, and the order is determined by the first position where they differ.\n\nTo find \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\), I would need more information about the structure of \\( K \\) and the specific ordering rules. Without additional context, I can only provide a general explanation of lexicographical order.\n\nIf \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\) is a specific concept or theorem, I might need to refer to additional information or definitions related to it. For now, I'll present the general idea of lexicographical order and its application to sequences.\n</think>\n\nTo determine \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\), we need to understand the context and definition of \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\). Assuming \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\) refers to the lexicographical order, here's a concise explanation:\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understanding Lexicographical Order:**\n   - Lexicographical order, also known as dictionary order, arranges elements by comparing them position by position.\n   - For sequences, it compares elements from left to right until a difference is found.\n\n2. **Application to \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\):**\n   - If \\( K \\) is a set of elements, \\( K^* \\) might represent sequences over \\( K \\).\n   - \\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\) would then be the set of all finite sequences over \\( K \\) ordered lexicographically.\n\n3. **Example:**\n   - Suppose \\( K = \\{a, b, c\\} \\).\n   - Sequences like \\( (a, b) \\) and \\( (a, c) \\) are ordered with \\( (a, b) < (a, c) \\) because the second element differs.\n   - Longer sequences are compared by their prefixes.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\( K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\) represents the lexicographical order of all finite sequences over the set \\( K \\), where sequences are compared element by element from left to right. The order is determined by the first differing element, with the sequence having the smaller element at that position being considered smaller overall.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{K^*_{\\text{lex}} \\text{ is the lexicographical order of all finite sequences over } K.}\n\\]"
