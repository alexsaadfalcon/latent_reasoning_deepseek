    "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether the function f(x\u2081, x\u2082) = x\u2081^\u03b1 x\u2082^(1-\u03b1) is convex, concave, quasiconvex, or quasiconcave. The domain is R\u00b2\u208a\u208a, which means both x\u2081 and x\u2082 are positive real numbers. The parameter \u03b1 is between 0 and 1, inclusive. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that convexity and concavity are properties related to the function's curvature. For functions of multiple variables, convexity is determined by the Hessian matrix. If the Hessian is positive semi-definite, the function is convex; if it's negative semi-definite, it's concave. But wait, actually, for convexity, the function is convex if the Hessian is positive semi-definite, and concave if the Hessian is negative semi-definite. But I might be mixing up the exact definitions. Let me double-check.\n\nNo, actually, for a function to be convex, the line segment between any two points on the graph of the function lies above the graph. For concave, it lies below. The Hessian being positive semi-definite implies convexity, and negative semi-definite implies concavity. So, I need to compute the Hessian of f and check its definiteness.\n\nBut before that, maybe I should recall the definitions of quasiconvexity and quasiconcavity. A function is quasiconvex if the sublevel sets are convex. Similarly, a function is quasiconcave if the superlevel sets are convex. So, I need to check whether the sublevel sets {x | f(x) \u2264 k} are convex for quasiconvexity, and whether the superlevel sets {x | f(x) \u2265 k} are convex for quasiconcavity.\n\nAlternatively, for quasiconvexity, the function should satisfy that for any two points x and y, and any \u03bb \u2208 [0,1], f(\u03bbx + (1-\u03bb)y) \u2264 max{f(x), f(y)}. Similarly, for quasiconcavity, f(\u03bbx + (1-\u03bb)y) \u2265 min{f(x), f(y)}.\n\nBut maybe computing the Hessian is more straightforward. Let me try that.\n\nSo, f(x\u2081, x\u2082) = x\u2081^\u03b1 x\u2082^(1-\u03b1). Let's compute the first and second derivatives.\n\nFirst, compute the first partial derivatives:\n\nf_x1 = \u03b1 x\u2081^(\u03b1 - 1) x\u2082^(1 - \u03b1)\nf_x2 = (1 - \u03b1) x\u2081^\u03b1 x\u2082^(-\u03b1)\n\nNow, compute the second partial derivatives.\n\nf_xx1 = \u03b1(\u03b1 - 1) x\u2081^(\u03b1 - 2) x\u2082^(1 - \u03b1)\nf_x2x2 = (1 - \u03b1)(-\u03b1) x\u2081^\u03b1 x\u2082^(-\u03b1 - 1)\nf_xx1x2 = f_x2x1 = \u03b1(1 - \u03b1) x\u2081^(\u03b1 - 2) x\u2082^(-\u03b1)\n\nSo, the Hessian matrix H is:\n\n[ f_xx1   f_xx1x2 ]\n[ f_xx1x2   f_x2x2 ]\n\nWhich is:\n\n[ \u03b1(\u03b1 - 1) x\u2081^(\u03b1 - 2) x\u2082^(1 - \u03b1)   \u03b1(1 - \u03b1) x\u2081^(\u03b1 - 2) x\u2082^(-\u03b1) ]\n[ \u03b1(1 - \u03b1) x\u2081^(\u03b1 - 2) x\u2082^(-\u03b1)   (1 - \u03b1)(-\u03b1) x\u2081^\u03b1 x\u2082^(-\u03b1 - 1) ]\n\nHmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor out some terms.\n\nLet me factor out x\u2081^(\u03b1 - 2) x\u2082^(-\u03b1) from the first row and column:\n\nFirst row: x\u2081^(\u03b1 - 2) x\u2082^(-\u03b1) [ \u03b1(\u03b1 - 1) x\u2082^(1 - \u03b1 + \u03b1)   \u03b1(1 - \u03b1) ]\nSimplify the exponents: 1 - \u03b1 + \u03b1 = 1, so it's x\u2081^(\u03b1 - 2) x\u2082^(-\u03b1) [ \u03b1(\u03b1 - 1) x\u2082   \u03b1(1 - \u03b1) ]\n\nSimilarly, the second row and column: x\u2081^(\u03b1 - 2) x\u2082^(-\u03b1) [ \u03b1(1 - \u03b1) x\u2082   (1 - \u03b1)(-\u03b1) x\u2081 ]\n\nSo, factoring out x\u2081^(\u03b1 - 2) x\u2082^(-\u03b1), the Hessian becomes:\n\nx\u2081^(\u03b1 - 2) x\u2082^(-\u03b1) * [ [ \u03b1(\u03b1 - 1) x\u2082   \u03b1(1 - \u03b1) ]\n                          [ \u03b1(1 - \u03b1)   (1 - \u03b1)(-\u03b1) x\u2081 ] ]\n\nNow, let's denote this as x^(\u03b1 - 2) x^(-\u03b1) * H, where H is the Hessian matrix without the x^(\u03b1 - 2) x^(-\u03b1) factor.\n\nSo, H = [ [ \u03b1(\u03b1 - 1) x\u2082   \u03b1(1 - \u03b1) ]\n        [ \u03b1(1 - \u03b1)   (1 - \u03b1)(-\u03b1) x\u2081 ] ]\n\nNow, to determine the definiteness of H, we can look at its leading principal minors.\n\nFirst minor: H11 = \u03b1(\u03b1 - 1) x\u2082\n\nSecond minor: H12 = det([H11 H12; H12 H22]) = H11 * H22 - H12^2\n\nBut since H is a 2x2 matrix, the determinant is H11 * H22 - H12^2.\n\nSo, let's compute H11, H12, H22.\n\nH11 = \u03b1(\u03b1 - 1) x\u2082\n\nH12 = \u03b1(1 - \u03b1)\n\nH22 = (1 - \u03b1)(-\u03b1) x\u2081\n\nSo, the determinant is:\n\nH11 * H22 - (H12)^2 = [\u03b1(\u03b1 - 1) x\u2082] * [(1 - \u03b1)(-\u03b1) x\u2081] - [\u03b1(1 - \u03b1)]^2\n\nSimplify:\n\nFirst term: \u03b1(\u03b1 - 1)(1 - \u03b1)(-\u03b1) x\u2081 x\u2082\n\nNote that (\u03b1 - 1)(1 - \u03b1) = -(1 - \u03b1)^2\n\nSo, first term becomes: \u03b1 * (- (1 - \u03b1)^2) * (-\u03b1) x\u2081 x\u2082 = \u03b1^2 (1 - \u03b1)^2 x\u2081 x\u2082\n\nSecond term: [\u03b1(1 - \u03b1)]^2 = \u03b1^2 (1 - \u03b1)^2\n\nSo, determinant = \u03b1^2 (1 - \u03b1)^2 x\u2081 x\u2082 - \u03b1^2 (1 - \u03b1)^2\n\nFactor out \u03b1^2 (1 - \u03b1)^2:\n\n= \u03b1^2 (1 - \u03b1)^2 (x\u2081 x\u2082 - 1)\n\nSo, the determinant of H is \u03b1^2 (1 - \u03b1)^2 (x\u2081 x\u2082 - 1)\n\nNow, since \u03b1 is between 0 and 1, \u03b1^2 and (1 - \u03b1)^2 are both non-negative. So, the sign of the determinant depends on (x\u2081 x\u2082 - 1).\n\nTherefore, the determinant is positive when x\u2081 x\u2082 > 1, negative when x\u2081 x\u2082 < 1, and zero when x\u2081 x\u2082 = 1.\n\nNow, the leading principal minor H11 is \u03b1(\u03b1 - 1) x\u2082.\n\nSince \u03b1 is between 0 and 1, (\u03b1 - 1) is negative. So, H11 = \u03b1(\u03b1 - 1) x\u2082 = negative * x\u2082.\n\nBut x\u2082 is positive because we are in R\u00b2\u208a\u208a. So, H11 is negative.\n\nTherefore, the first leading principal minor is negative.\n\nThe second leading principal minor is the determinant, which is positive when x\u2081 x\u2082 > 1, negative when x\u2081 x\u2082 < 1, and zero when x\u2081 x\u2082 = 1.\n\nSo, the Hessian is positive semi-definite when determinant is non-negative and H11 is non-negative. But H11 is negative, so determinant must be non-negative for positive semi-definiteness. So, determinant is non-negative when x\u2081 x\u2082 \u2265 1.\n\nSimilarly, the Hessian is negative semi-definite when determinant is non-positive and H11 is non-positive. But H11 is negative, so determinant must be non-positive for negative semi-definiteness. So, determinant is non-positive when x\u2081 x\u2082 \u2264 1.\n\nBut wait, the Hessian is indefinite when determinant is negative, which is when x\u2081 x\u2082 < 1.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\n- When x\u2081 x\u2082 > 1: Hessian is positive semi-definite (since determinant is positive and H11 is negative, but wait, H11 is negative, so actually, the Hessian is indefinite? Wait, no. Wait, H11 is negative, determinant is positive, so the Hessian is indefinite.\n\nWait, no. For positive semi-definite, all leading principal minors must be non-negative. But H11 is negative, so it can't be positive semi-definite. For negative semi-definite, all leading principal minors must be non-positive. H11 is negative, determinant is positive when x\u2081 x\u2082 > 1, which is positive, so determinant"
