In how many different ways could a suitable set of $k$ seats be chosen?\n<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c>\n<think>\n<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where there are n seats in a doctor's waiting room, and k patients are sitting down in a particular order from left to right. The condition is that no two patients are sitting in adjacent seats. I need to figure out how many different ways a suitable set of k seats can be chosen. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have n seats arranged in a row, and we need to choose k seats such that no two chosen seats are next to each other. The patients are sitting in a particular order, but since they're just choosing seats, the order might not matter here. So, it's more about selecting k seats out of n with the restriction that no two are adjacent.\n\nWait, actually, the problem says \"they sit so that no two of them are in adjacent seats.\" So, it's about selecting k seats where none are adjacent. That sounds like a classic combinatorial problem. I remember something about combinations with restrictions.\n\nLet me recall. If we have n seats and we want to choose k seats such that no two are adjacent, the number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula C(n - k + 1, k). Is that right? Let me verify.\n\nImagine that we have n seats. If we want to place k non-adjacent people, we can think of it as placing k objects with at least one space between them. To model this, we can use the concept of \"stars and bars.\" If we have k patients, they will occupy k seats, and we need at least one empty seat between each pair of patients. So, the minimum number of seats required is k + (k - 1) = 2k - 1. But in our case, we have n seats, so the remaining seats can be distributed as extra spaces before, between, or after the patients.\n\nWait, so if we have n seats and we need to place k patients with at least one seat between each, we can model this as placing k patients and n - k empty seats, with the condition that no two patients are adjacent. To ensure no two patients are adjacent, we can think of the k patients as being placed in the n - (k - 1) seats. Because between each patient, there must be at least one empty seat, so we subtract (k - 1) from n to account for these mandatory empty seats.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways is C(n - k + 1, k). Let me write that down:\n\nNumber of ways = C(n - k + 1, k)\n\nBut let me think again to make sure. Another way to approach this is by considering the seats as positions. If we have n seats, and we need to choose k seats with no two adjacent, we can model this as placing k objects with at least one space between them. So, the number of ways is equal to the number of ways to choose k seats such that there is at least one seat between each pair.\n\nThis is similar to arranging k objects with required gaps. The formula for this is indeed C(n - k + 1, k). Let me test this with a small example.\n\nSuppose n = 5 and k = 2. How many ways are there to choose 2 non-adjacent seats?\n\nThe seats are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\nPossible selections:\n1 and 3\n1 and 4\n1 and 5\n2 and 4\n2 and 5\n3 and 5\n\nThat's 6 ways. Now, using the formula C(n - k + 1, k) = C(5 - 2 + 1, 2) = C(4, 2) = 6. That matches. So, the formula seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: n = 4, k = 2.\n\nPossible selections:\n1 and 3\n1 and 4\n2 and 4\n\nThat's 3 ways. Using the formula: C(4 - 2 + 1, 2) = C(3, 2) = 3. Correct again.\n\nWait, let me try n = 3, k = 2.\n\nPossible selections:\n1 and 3\n\nOnly 1 way. Formula: C(3 - 2 + 1, 2) = C(2, 2) = 1. Correct.\n\nWhat about n = 2, k = 1? Then, C(2 - 1 + 1, 1) = C(2, 1) = 2. Which is correct because there are two seats, so two ways.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says \"k patients sit down in a particular order from left to right.\" Does that affect anything? Hmm, the problem is about choosing seats, not arranging the patients. So, the order in which the patients sit doesn't matter for the seat selection. So, the number of ways is just the number of combinations, not permutations.\n\nTherefore, the formula C(n - k + 1, k) should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is using the stars and bars theorem. If we have n seats, and we need to place k patients with at least one empty seat between each, we can model this as placing k patients and n - k empty seats, with the condition that no two patients are adjacent.\n\nTo ensure no two patients are adjacent, we can imagine that each patient must have at least one empty seat after them. So, we can represent this as:\n\nE * P * E * P * E * ... where E is an empty seat and P is a patient. But since we have n seats, the number of empty seats is n - k.\n\nBut since we need at least one empty seat between each patient, we can think of the k patients as being placed in the n - (k - 1) seats. Because we have k patients and k - 1 mandatory empty seats between them, so the remaining empty seats can be distributed as additional empty seats before, between, or after the patients.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways is equal to the number of ways to distribute n - k empty seats into k + 1 gaps (before the first patient, between each pair of patients, and after the last patient). This is a classic stars and bars problem, where we have n - k identical items (empty seats) and k + 1 distinct boxes (gaps). The formula for this is C((n - k) + (k + 1) - 1, (k + 1) - 1) = C(n, k). Wait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, no, hold on. The number of gaps is k + 1, and the number of items to distribute is n - k. So, the number of ways is C((n - k) + (k + 1) - 1, (k + 1) - 1) = C(n, k). But that can't be, because in our earlier example with n = 5, k = 2, C(5, 2) = 10, but we only have 6 valid ways. So, that approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of gaps. Let me think again. If we have k patients, there are k + 1 gaps: before the first patient, between each pair of patients, and after the last patient. So, the number of gaps is k + 1. We have n - k empty seats to distribute into these k + 1 gaps, with each gap having at least 0 empty seats (since we can have empty seats before the first patient, but not necessarily after the last patient, unless we want to. Wait, actually, in our problem, we don't have a restriction on the number of empty seats after the last patient, so each gap can have 0 or more empty seats.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways is C((n - k) + (k + 1) - 1, (k + 1) - 1) = C(n, k). But that's not correct because in our test case, n = 5, k = 2, C(5, 2) = 10, but we have only 6 valid ways. So, clearly, this approach is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula. Maybe the number of gaps is k, not k + 1. Let me think. If we have k patients, there are k - 1 gaps between them, and two additional gaps: one before the first patient and one after the last patient. So, total gaps are k + 1. So, the number of gaps is still k + 1.\n\nBut in the stars and bars formula, the number of ways to distribute m identical items into r distinct boxes is C(m + r - 1, r - 1). So, in our case, m = n - k, r = k + 1. So, the number of ways is C((n - k) + (k + 1) - 1, (k + 1) - 1) = C(n, k). But again, that gives us C(n, k), which is not correct for our test case.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the initial approach. If we have n seats and we need to choose k seats with no two adjacent, we can model this as placing k patients with at least one empty seat between them. So, the number of ways is equal to the number of ways to choose k seats such that there is at least one empty seat between each"
