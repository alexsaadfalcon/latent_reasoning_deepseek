E |x^3| \u2264 \u03b1 E |x|.\n<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c>\n<think>\n<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this problem here: \"Which of the following conditions are convex in p? E |x\u00b3| \u2264 \u03b1 E |x|.\" Hmm, I need to figure out which of these conditions are convex in p. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.\n\nFirst, I know that a function is convex if its epigraph is a convex set. But in this context, it seems like we're dealing with conditions on expectations, specifically involving E |x\u00b3| and E |x|. So, maybe I need to analyze the convexity of the function defined by E |x\u00b3| and E |x|.\n\nWait, but the question is about conditions being convex in p. Hmm, p is probably a parameter here. Maybe p is a variable or a parameter in some function or inequality. I need to clarify what p represents. Is it a parameter in the expectation E |x\u00b3| \u2264 \u03b1 E |x|? Or is p part of the condition itself?\n\nLooking back, the problem says \"Which of the following conditions are convex in p?\" So, perhaps each condition is an inequality involving p, and we need to determine if that inequality defines a convex set in terms of p.\n\nBut wait, the inequality given is E |x\u00b3| \u2264 \u03b1 E |x|. That doesn't involve p. Maybe p is a parameter in the definition of x or in the expectation. Maybe x is a random variable depending on p, so E |x\u00b3| and E |x| are functions of p. So, the condition is E |x\u00b3| \u2264 \u03b1 E |x|, and we need to see if this condition is convex in p.\n\nBut convexity in p would mean that the set of p's for which E |x\u00b3| \u2264 \u03b1 E |x| holds is a convex set. So, perhaps we need to analyze whether the inequality is convex in p.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the convexity of the function f(p) = E |x\u00b3| - \u03b1 E |x|, and whether it's convex in p. That would make sense because convexity in p would relate to the function being convex.\n\nSo, assuming that, let's think about f(p) = E |x\u00b3| - \u03b1 E |x|. We need to check if f(p) is convex in p. For f(p) to be convex, its second derivative with respect to p should be non-negative for all p in the domain.\n\nBut wait, x might be a random variable depending on p, so E |x\u00b3| and E |x| are expectations that depend on p. Therefore, f(p) is a function of p, and we need to check its convexity.\n\nBut how do we determine if f(p) is convex? Let's recall that a function is convex if its second derivative is non-negative. So, if we can compute the second derivative of f(p) with respect to p, and show that it's non-negative, then f(p) is convex.\n\nHowever, computing the second derivative might be complicated because it depends on the distribution of x, which is determined by p. So, unless we have more information about how p affects x, it's hard to proceed.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is simpler. Perhaps it's about the convexity of the inequality E |x\u00b3| \u2264 \u03b1 E |x| in terms of p. That is, for a given p, is the inequality convex in p? But that doesn't quite make sense because p is a parameter, not a variable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the convexity of the set of p's for which E |x\u00b3| \u2264 \u03b1 E |x| holds. So, if we fix x, then E |x\u00b3| and E |x| are constants with respect to p, so the inequality becomes a constant \u2264 \u03b1 * constant. But that would just be a linear inequality in \u03b1, which is always convex in \u03b1, but not necessarily in p.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is about the convexity of the function f(p) = E |x\u00b3| - \u03b1 E |x|, and whether this function is convex in p. So, if we can show that f(p) is convex in p, then the inequality E |x\u00b3| \u2264 \u03b1 E |x| is convex in p.\n\nBut again, without knowing how p affects x, it's hard to compute the derivatives. Maybe the problem is assuming that x is a linear function of p, or that p is a parameter in the definition of x. For example, if x is a linear function of p, say x = p, then E |x\u00b3| = E |p\u00b3| and E |x| = E |p|. Then, the inequality becomes E |p\u00b3| \u2264 \u03b1 E |p|.\n\nBut even then, E |p\u00b3| and E |p| are functions of p, so f(p) = E |p\u00b3| - \u03b1 E |p|. To check if f(p) is convex, we need to check if its second derivative is non-negative.\n\nBut since p is a scalar, the second derivative would be the derivative of the first derivative. Let's denote E |p\u00b3| as a function of p, say g(p) = E |p\u00b3|. Similarly, E |p| is another function, say h(p) = E |p|. Then, f(p) = g(p) - \u03b1 h(p).\n\nThe first derivative f\u2019(p) = g\u2019(p) - \u03b1 h\u2019(p). The second derivative f''(p) = g''(p) - \u03b1 h''(p). If f''(p) \u2265 0 for all p, then f(p) is convex.\n\nBut computing g\u2019(p) and h\u2019(p) would require knowing the distribution of p. Since p is a parameter, unless it's given a specific distribution, we can't compute these derivatives. So, perhaps the problem is assuming that p is a constant, and x is a random variable depending on p.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is about the convexity of the inequality in terms of p, meaning that for a given p, the inequality is convex in p. But p is a parameter, so convexity in p would mean that the inequality is convex as a function of p. But since p is a parameter, not a variable, I'm a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the convexity of the set of p's for which E |x\u00b3| \u2264 \u03b1 E |x| holds. That is, for a given x, the inequality is a linear inequality in \u03b1, which is always convex in \u03b1. But the question is about convexity in p, so maybe p is a variable, and x is a function of p.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think of p as a variable and x as a function of p. For example, suppose x is a random variable that depends on p, so E |x\u00b3| and E |x| are functions of p. Then, the inequality E |x\u00b3| \u2264 \u03b1 E |x| defines a set of p's. We need to check if this set is convex in p.\n\nBut without knowing the specific form of x as a function of p, it's hard to proceed. Maybe the problem is more about the convexity of the inequality itself, regardless of p. But the question says \"in p,\" so it's likely that p is a variable, and the inequality is convex in p.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the convexity of the function f(p) = E |x\u00b3| - \u03b1 E |x|, and whether this function is convex in p. So, if we can show that f(p) is convex, then the inequality is convex in p.\n\nBut again, without knowing how p affects x, it's difficult. Maybe the problem is assuming that x is a linear function of p, say x = p, so E |x\u00b3| = E |p\u00b3| and E |x| = E |p|. Then, f(p) = E |p\u00b3| - \u03b1 E |p|. To check convexity, we need to compute f''(p).\n\nLet me try that. Suppose x = p, so E |x\u00b3| = E |p\u00b3| and E |x| = E |p|. Let's assume p is a scalar random variable. Then, f(p) = E |p\u00b3| - \u03b1 E |p|.\n\nCompute f'(p): f'(p) = d/dp [E |p\u00b3|] - \u03b1 d/dp [E |p|]. The derivative of |p\u00b3| with respect to p is 3p\u00b2 sign(p\u00b3) = 3p\u00b2 sign(p). Similarly, the derivative of |p| is sign(p). So, f'(p) = 3 E [p\u00b2 sign(p)] - \u03b1 sign(p) E [1].\n\nWait, actually, let me correct that. The derivative of |p\u00b3| with respect to p is 3p\u00b2 sign(p\u00b3) = 3p\u00b2 sign(p). Similarly, the derivative of |p| is sign(p). So, f'(p) = 3 E [p\u00b2 sign(p)] - \u03b1 sign(p) E [1].\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The derivative of |p\u00b3| with respect to p is 3p\u00b2 sign(p\u00b3) = 3p\u00b2 sign(p). Similarly, the derivative of |p| is sign(p). So, f'(p) = 3 E [p\u00b2 sign(p)] - \u03b1 sign(p) E [1].\n\nBut E [1] is just 1, so f'(p) = 3 E [p\u00b2 sign(p"
