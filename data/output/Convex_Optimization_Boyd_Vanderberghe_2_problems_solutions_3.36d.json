    "problem": "Derive the conjugates of the following functions. Power function. f(x) = x^p on R_++, where p > 1. Repeat for p < 0.",
    "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the conjugates of the function f(x) = x^p on R_++ for two cases: when p > 1 and when p < 0. Hmm, I remember that conjugate functions are related to convex analysis and optimization. Let me try to recall the definition.\n\nThe conjugate function, often denoted as f*(y), is defined as the supremum of the linear function g(y) = \u27e8x, y\u27e9 - f(x) over all x in the domain. In this case, the domain is R_++, which is the set of positive real numbers. So, f*(y) = sup{ x^p - x y | x > 0 }.\n\nAlright, so I need to find the supremum of the function h(x) = x^p - x y for x > 0. To find the supremum, I should take the derivative of h(x) with respect to x and set it equal to zero to find critical points.\n\nLet's compute h'(x). The derivative of x^p is p x^{p-1}, and the derivative of -x y is -y. So, h'(x) = p x^{p-1} - y.\n\nSetting h'(x) = 0 gives p x^{p-1} - y = 0, which simplifies to x^{p-1} = y / p. Solving for x, we get x = (y / p)^{1/(p-1)}.\n\nNow, I need to check if this critical point is a maximum. Since p > 1, the exponent 1/(p-1) is positive, so x is positive, which is in the domain R_++. To confirm it's a maximum, let's check the second derivative.\n\nThe second derivative h''(x) is the derivative of h'(x), which is p(p-1) x^{p-2}. Since p > 1, p(p-1) is positive, and x^{p-2} is positive for x > 0. Therefore, h''(x) > 0, which means the function h(x) is concave down at the critical point, so it's a maximum.\n\nGreat, so the maximum occurs at x = (y / p)^{1/(p-1)}. Now, let's plug this back into h(x) to find the conjugate.\n\nh(x) = x^p - x y. Substituting x:\n\nh(x) = [(y / p)^{1/(p-1)}]^p - [(y / p)^{1/(p-1)}] y.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: [(y / p)^{1/(p-1)}]^p = (y / p)^{p/(p-1)}.\n\nSecond term: [(y / p)^{1/(p-1)}] y = (y / p)^{1/(p-1)} * y = (y^{1 + 1/(p-1)}) / p^{1/(p-1)}.\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\n1 + 1/(p-1) = (p - 1 + 1)/(p - 1) = p / (p - 1).\n\nSo, the second term becomes y^{p/(p-1)} / p^{1/(p-1)}.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nh(x) = (y^{p/(p-1)}) / p^{p/(p-1)} - (y^{p/(p-1)}) / p^{1/(p-1)}.\n\nFactor out y^{p/(p-1)} / p^{1/(p-1)}:\n\nh(x) = (y^{p/(p-1)} / p^{1/(p-1)}) [1 / p^{(p-1)/(p-1)} - 1].\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\n1 / p^{(p-1)/(p-1)} = 1 / p^{1} = 1/p.\n\nSo, h(x) = (y^{p/(p-1)} / p^{1/(p-1)}) (1/p - 1).\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\n1/p - 1 = (1 - p)/p.\n\nSo, h(x) = (y^{p/(p-1)} / p^{1/(p-1)}) * (1 - p)/p.\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n= (1 - p) y^{p/(p-1)} / (p^{1/(p-1)} * p).\n\nNote that p^{1/(p-1)} * p = p^{1 + 1/(p-1)}.\n\nSimplify the exponent:\n\n1 + 1/(p-1) = (p - 1 + 1)/(p - 1) = p/(p - 1).\n\nSo, p^{1 + 1/(p-1)} = p^{p/(p - 1)}.\n\nTherefore, h(x) = (1 - p) y^{p/(p - 1)} / p^{p/(p - 1)}.\n\nFactor out the negative sign:\n\n= (p - 1) y^{p/(p - 1)} / p^{p/(p - 1)}.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n= (p - 1) / p^{p/(p - 1)} * y^{p/(p - 1)}.\n\nAlternatively, we can express this as:\n\n= (p - 1) / p^{p/(p - 1)} * y^{p/(p - 1)}.\n\nBut let me see if I can write this in a more compact form. Notice that (p - 1) / p^{p/(p - 1)} can be written as (p - 1) * p^{-p/(p - 1)}.\n\nAlternatively, since p^{p/(p - 1)} = p^{1 + 1/(p - 1)} = p * p^{1/(p - 1)}, so:\n\n= (p - 1) / (p * p^{1/(p - 1)}) * y^{p/(p - 1)}.\n\n= (p - 1)/p * p^{-1/(p - 1)} * y^{p/(p - 1)}.\n\nBut I think the first expression is simpler:\n\n= (p - 1) / p^{p/(p - 1)} * y^{p/(p - 1)}.\n\nAlternatively, we can write this as:\n\n= (p - 1) / p^{p/(p - 1)} * y^{p/(p - 1)}.\n\nBut perhaps we can write it as:\n\n= (p - 1) / p^{p/(p - 1)} * y^{p/(p - 1)}.\n\nAlternatively, factor out the exponent:\n\n= (p - 1) / p^{p/(p - 1)} * y^{p/(p - 1)}.\n\nWait, maybe we can write this as:\n\n= (p - 1) / p^{p/(p - 1)} * y^{p/(p - 1)}.\n\nAlternatively, since p^{p/(p - 1)} = e^{(p/(p - 1)) ln p}, but that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, let's write it as:\n\n= (p - 1) / p^{p/(p - 1)} * y^{p/(p - 1)}.\n\nAlternatively, factor out the exponent:\n\n= (p - 1) * y^{p/(p - 1)} / p^{p/(p - 1)}.\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\n= (p - 1) / p^{p/(p - 1)} * y^{p/(p - 1)}.\n\nI think that's as simplified as it gets.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the conjugate function f*(y) is:\n\nf*(y) = (p - 1) / p^{p/(p - 1)} * y^{p/(p - 1)}.\n\nBut let me check if this makes sense for specific values of p.\n\nFor example, when p = 2, which is greater than 1, the conjugate should be f*(y) = (2 - 1)/2^{2/(2 - 1)} * y^{2/(2 - 1)} = 1 / 2^2 * y^2 = (1/4) y^2. Wait, but I know that the conjugate of x^2 is (1/4) y^2, which is correct.\n\nAnother test: when p approaches 1 from above. Let's say p = 1 + \u03b5, where \u03b5 is small. Then, f*(y) = (1 + \u03b5 - 1) / (1 + \u03b5)^{(1 + \u03b5)/\u03b5} * y^{(1 + \u03b5)/\u03b5}.\n\nSimplify numerator: \u03b5.\n\nDenominator: (1 + \u03b5)^{(1 + \u03b5)/\u03b5} = e^{(1 + \u03b5)/\u03b5 * ln(1 + \u03b5)} \u2248 e^{(1 + \u03b5)/\u03b5 * (\u03b5 - \u03b5^2/2 + ...)} \u2248 e^{1 + \u03b5 - \u03b5/2 + ...} \u2248 e^{1 + \u03b5/2}.\n\nSo, denominator \u2248 e^{1 + \u03b5/2}.\n\nNumerator \u2248 \u03b5.\n\nSo, f*(y) \u2248 \u03b5 / e^{1 + \u03b5/2} * y^{(1 + \u03b5)/\u03b5} \u2248 (\u03b5 / e) * y^{1 + \u03b5/\u03b5} \u2248 (\u03b5 / e) * y^{1"
